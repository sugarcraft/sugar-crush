/**
 * {@see Bootstrap::readUserConfig()} once it has layers under it, and the two
 * things the wiring must not break.
 *
 * Before this change-set there was one settings file and `grep -rln
 * 'settings.json' src/` returned nothing, so every case below fails against the
 * unlayered build — most of them by returning `null` for a value that is now
 * supposed to come out of a file that build never opened.
 *
 * WHY THE PROJECT TIER NEEDS A GATE AT ALL: layer 1 arrived with a clone.
 * `.sugar-crush/settings.json` inside a checkout was written by whoever wrote
 * the repository, so honouring it ungated would let a hostile repo choose the
 * provider every prompt is sent to and force files into the system prompt. The
 * gate is {@see LayeredSettings::PROJECT_SETTINGS_TRUST_KEY} in the user's own
 * config — a fourth key of the shape `trustedProjectHooks`/`trustedProjectMcp`/
 * `trustedProjectCommands` already use, separate from all three because
 * trusting a repo to start an MCP server is a different grant from trusting it
 * to pick a model.
