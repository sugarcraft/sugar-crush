/**
 * The boot path that makes ONE rulebook toggle set serve TWO owners, pinned from
 * `Bootstrap::chat()` outward.
 *
 * ## The door this closes
 *
 * `Chat` is the only writer of the session's {@see RulesState} (the `/rules`
 * command is handled there) and `EngineBackend` is the only reader (it builds each
 * turn's `App`, and the rules splice subtracts whatever the App carries). They are
 * not in a call chain with each other, so `Bootstrap::chat()` creates the instance
 * ONCE and hands it to both. Hand-writing two instances instead — the shape the
 * boot path degrades to if either half of that hand-out is deleted — is not a crash
 * and not a wrong value. It is a `/rules` reply that says `OFF for this session`,
 * a transcript that agrees, a listing that agrees, and a prompt that goes on
 * carrying the pack the operator just switched off, for the rest of the session.
 *
 * Nothing in the suite could see that before this file. Both halves were unit-tested
 * at their own end (`Chat` answered correctly; `EngineBackend` forwarded whatever it
 * was given) and the render seam was pinned from a hand-built App, which is exactly
 * the class of gap this audit keeps finding: a subsystem green at both ends and a
 * no-op in production. The unit tests that build their own `Chat` pass with or
 * without the boot wiring, because they never route through it.
 *
 * The render seam itself — does a toggled pack leave the bytes — is pinned from a
 * hand-built App at
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Context\RulebookPromptRenderTest::testTheSamePackRendersIntoThePromptWhenOnAndOutOfItWhenToggledOff()};
 * this file does not re-argue it, it argues that the LAUNCHED pair feeds that seam
 * one shared set.
 *
 * ## Why the assertion is object identity AND a byte change, not either alone
 *
 * `assertSame` on the two accessors proves the two owners hold one instance but says
 * nothing about whether anything READS it — a backend that stores the set and never
 * carries it onto the turn's App would pass on identity alone. The render proves the
 * read but not the sharing — a hand-passed set renders identically. Only together do
 * they describe the wiring: the SAME object, whose mutation by the shell's own
 * keystroke path, changes the bytes the launched backend would send.
 *
 * ## Why ONE launch, and the hazard recorded next door
 *
 * {@see AgentManagerWiringTest}'s class docblock records that the suite has two
 * load-sensitive forked-completion tests, and that adding ANY `Bootstrap::chat()`
 * launching file to the run destabilised them when it was measured on an otherwise
 * untouched checkout. This file pays for exactly ONE launch for the whole class, the
 * same frugality that file argues for, and its existence is therefore itself a
 * measurement of that recorded hazard rather than an assumption about it. The P6.S4
 * config-seed pin reuses that one launch rather than asking for a second: a
 * disable-list has no observable effect except at boot, so it is served by capturing
 * the launch's own output in `setUpBeforeClass()` — see
 * {@see self::testTheLaunchSeedsTheDisableListFromTheUsersOwnConfig()}.
 *
     * `Bootstrap::chat()` is the seam this reads the wiring off, because it is the one
     * place the pair is created together: `Bootstrap::app()` — the entry `bin/sugarcrush`
     * actually calls — builds its shell by calling `chat()`, so every shell the binary
     * ever hosts, wrapped in `Program` or not, comes through the lines pinned here. The
     * narrower seam is also the quieter one: `app()` additionally constructs the session
     * stores and the worktree machinery around the same call, and none of that is what
     * this file is about.
 *
 * The prompt bytes are NOT observable through the launched backend's own provider:
 * with the backend-selection chain cleared, `Bootstrap::backend()` degrades to an
 * {@see EchoProvider}, which answers with prose and never receives the system prompt
 * at all. So the byte half renders the state the LAUNCHED backend carries through
 * {@see Runtime::buildSystemPrompt()} — the same splice `Runtime::run()` uses — on a
 * fresh Runtime per call, because the prompt is memoised per-Runtime (§17.2) and two
 * renders off one instance would return one string twice and make the comparison
 * vacuous.

     *
     * This is the §1.10 half of P6.S4. {@see RulesState::new()}'s `$disabled`
     * parameter has existed since P6.S3 with zero production callers passing an
     * argument, and no amount of unit coverage of that constructor could have said
     * the launch uses it — so this test starts at `Bootstrap::chat()` and reads what
     * the launch produced.
     *
     * ## WHY BOTH NAMES COME FROM `settings.json` AND NONE FROM `config.json`
     *
     * The obvious fixture — one pack in each file — is not a test. `disabledRules` is
     * ONE key and {@see LayeredSettings::merge()} resolves keys whole-value with the
     * CLI-written file on top, so a name in the hand-authored file is invisible to
     * every reader the moment `config.json` carries the key at all. MEASURED on this
     * checkout: with `["from-settings"]` in one file and `["from-config"]` in the
     * other, `Bootstrap::readUserConfig()['disabledRules'] === ['from-config']` — one
     * value, not a merged list. Such a fixture would pin the `config.json` route twice
     * and the `settings.json` route — the file this step exists to read, because a
     * machine-written file is not where anyone spells out a rulebook name by hand —
     * not once: rewriting the seed to read {@see Bootstrap::rawUserConfig()} directly,
     * which is `config.json` alone, would leave it GREEN.
     *
     * Sole supplier is therefore what gives that mutation something to break, and the
     * claim has to stop right there. WHAT THIS FIXTURE DOES NOT PIN: `config.json` is
     * written as `{}`, and merging an empty layer is the identity, so the merged list
     * and the `settings.json` list are THE SAME LIST here, and a seed reading
     * `LayeredSettings::userLayer()` — or `settings.json` by any other route — is
     * indistinguishable under every assertion in this method. Measured rather than
     * argued: with the seed rewritten to read the user layer directly, all four tests
     * in this class stayed green. So this test proves one thing — the seed is not
     * `config.json` alone — and the opposite direction is pinned in
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Cli\BootstrapLayeredSettingsTest::testDisabledRulesReachesTheMergedConfigFromEitherUserFile()},
     * the only fixture that gives the two files different values and composes the
     * merged read with the filter and the constructor, and at
     * {@see self::testTheSeedListIsBuiltFromTheMergedReadRatherThanFromEitherSingleUserFile()}.
     * Together the two files cover the whole route from either file to the launch;
     * neither is asked to pretend it covers the other's direction.
     *
     * The exact-list assert on {@see self::$disabledAtLaunch} is also the filter's
     * test: the file this class seeds names the packs ALONGSIDE a blank string, a
     * whitespace-only string, an int and a nested array, and a seed that forwarded
     * any of those would have thrown out of `RulesState::new()` and failed the
     * launch itself. So one assertion pins "both names arrived" and "the junk did
     * not" — the two polarities of the same guard, both through the production path.
     *
     * And the absence claim carries its known-positive control IN THIS TEST, through
     * the same renderer: the fixture re-enabled both packs after capturing the launch
     * evidence, so rendering the SAME state again must now show both sentinels. Without
     * that second half, "a sentinel is absent" would be equally consistent with a pack
     * that was never loaded, never named in the file, or simply mis-seeded.

    /**
     * Three packs in the user tier, plus the hand-authored settings file that turns
     * two of them off.
     *
     * The choice of `rulebooks/` over `rules/` is arbitrary and said as much: both
     * directories are walked by {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\RuleLoader::loadUserRules()}
     * and {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\RuleLoader::loadUserRulebooks()}, both are
     * rendered behind the same fence, and each half already has its own render pin
     * next door. One directory is seeded because the test needs a pack, not because
     * the directory matters; seeding both would only add a second file to keep track
     * of, and the collision case between them belongs to
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Context\RuleLoaderTest::testTheSameStemInBothUserDirectoriesStaysTwoPacksToggledByOneName()}
     * and to {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Commands\RulesCommandTest::testTogglingANameTwoPacksShareDisclosesThatBothMoved()},
     * not here.
     *
     * ## `settings.json` is the SOLE supplier of `disabledRules`; `config.json` has none
     *
     * Not an oversight and not a simplification — the polarity is what makes the seed
     * pin non-vacuous. {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Config\LayeredSettings::merge()} resolves
     * ONE key whole-value with the CLI-written file on top (measured: a name in each
     * file yields the `config.json` list alone), so any name written into
     * `config.json` here would eclipse the `settings.json` names and the launch test
     * below would then be pinning the deprecated file twice while saying nothing about
     * the file this step exists to read. The `config.json` half of that route is pinned
     * where it can be seen on its own, at
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Cli\BootstrapLayeredSettingsTest::testDisabledRulesReachesTheMergedConfigFromEitherUserFile()}.
     * The file is still written — with `0600`, as every policy file here is — so the
     * stack under test has its real four layers. WHAT THAT DOES NOT BUY, stated so the
     * next reader does not over-read it: an empty `config.json` is the identity for
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Config\LayeredSettings::merge()}, so this fixture pins
     * the settings route and says nothing about the merged ranking. That direction
     * lives in `BootstrapLayeredSettingsTest`, whose two-file case gives the two files
     * DIFFERENT lists.
     *
     * The `disabledRules` value written there is deliberately NOT the tidy
     * `["quiet"]` a config would show: it is two names followed by a blank string, a
     * whitespace-only string, an int and a nested array. The two blanks are the
     * load-bearing entries — they price the `trim($pack) !== ''` clause, and
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\RulesState::new()} rejects a blank outright, so an
     * unfiltered seed makes the LAUNCH throw. The int and the nested array are realism
     * rather than coverage: they price only the `is_string` clause, and the
     * eleven-shape table at
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Cli\BootstrapLayeredSettingsTest::testTheRulesSeedKeepsOnlyUsablePackNamesFromEveryJunkShape()}
     * is what pins that clause for real. What this fixture earns by carrying them is
     * one launch proving both halves of P6.S4 together — that the names in the
     * operator's own settings file reach the prompt, which is what
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\RulesState::new()}'s `$disabled` parameter had
     * never done in production before this step, and that the junk around them is
     * filtered on the way in rather than thrown out of. A `try`/`catch` would have
     * hidden the first by turning "the junk was refused" into "nothing was disabled".
     *
     * `PACK` is NOT named in the list, so the seeded packs and the toggled pack stay
     * two different claims.
