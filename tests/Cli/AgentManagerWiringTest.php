/**
 * Reachability tests for crush_code.md Phase 1 item 1: "Construct a real
 * AgentManager inside Bootstrap::chat()".
 *
 * The failure mode this whole audit keeps finding is a subsystem that is built,
 * unit-tested and green while being a guaranteed no-op in production, so a test
 * that only proves `new AgentManager(...)` works would restate the bug rather
 * than close it. Every test here therefore starts at {@see Bootstrap::app()} —
 * the shell `bin/sugarcrush` hands to `Program` on its final line, which hosts
 * the {@see Bootstrap::chat()} the wiring lives in — and each one FAILS if the
 * `agentManager:` argument is removed from `Bootstrap::chat()` again. Each
 * docblock says what specifically breaks it.
 *
 * ## Why this class shares ONE launch across its tests
 *
 * `Bootstrap::app()`/`chat()` is not a cheap fixture: it opens a SQLite session
 * store, seeds a row, scans skills, builds the whole engine tool set and now
 * the agent roster. This class therefore pays for exactly two launches (one
 * against a repo with valid presets, one against a repo with a malformed one)
 * and every test reads from them.
 *
 * That frugality is deliberate rather than stylistic. The suite has two
 * forked-completion tests —
 * `Integration\BinSugarcrushWiringTest::testDoctorToolIsReachableEndToEndThroughARealChatTurn`
 * and `Integration\SystemPromptWiringTest::testARealChatKeystrokeTurnDeliversBothHalves`
 * — that are known load-sensitive flakes, and adding ANY launch-based test file
 * to the run destabilises them. That was verified against an OTHERWISE
 * UNTOUCHED checkout: a file of 11, and a file of 22, tests doing nothing but
 * `Bootstrap::chat()` + an assertion each wedged the run on unmodified source,
 * while the same checkout without the file was green. So the fragility is the
 * suite's, not this file's — but there is no reason to make it worse, and a
 * reachability test for `Bootstrap::chat()` cannot avoid launching at all.
 *
 * Sharing mutable state across tests is the cost. It is contained by having the
 * tests that delegate remove their own sub-agents in a `finally`, so no test
 * depends on running before or after any other.
 *
 * Lives under `tests/Cli/` beside {@see BootstrapTest} and
 * {@see SessionRetentionWiringTest} because {@see Bootstrap} is `src/Cli/`'s
 * class and this is its wiring.
 *
 * The bin script itself cannot be driven end to end from a test: it ends in
 * `Program::run()`, which attaches to a real TTY and blocks. The bin ->
 * Bootstrap link is pinned by source instead
 * ({@see testTheBinaryHandsProgramTheShellThatCarriesTheManager}), which is the
 * same reasoning {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Integration\BinSugarcrushWiringTest}
 * and {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Integration\FeatWiringReachabilityTest}
 * already document.
