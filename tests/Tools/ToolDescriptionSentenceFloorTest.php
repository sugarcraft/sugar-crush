/**
 * Every wired built-in tool ships a description of at least three sentences.
 *
 * `description()` is the model's only first-contact documentation for a tool it
 * has not yet called this session, and a one-line sentence cannot carry the four
 * things the Anthropic rubric asks for — what it does, when NOT to reach for it,
 * what each parameter means, and what it does not return. The plan's P9.S4 step
 * rewrote five such descriptions to multi-sentence man-pages; this is the guard
 * that keeps the whole corpus there, so the next terse tool cannot slip back in.
 *
 * THE DOMAIN IS THE WIRED BUILT-INS, and it is derived rather than listed, in
 * the same move {@see BuiltInToolCorpus} made for the rest of the tool suite: the
 * roster is every tool {@see BuiltInToolCorpus::instances()} builds, MINUS every
 * class named in {@see BuiltInToolCorpus::dynamicToolClasses()}. That subtraction
 * is by CLASS KIND, not by a list of names this file maintains: the excluded
 * bridge wraps one descriptor discovered from a project's MCP server, so the text
 * it returns is that server's prose, not anything authored in `src/` — holding it
 * to this repo's sentence floor would test a string this codebase does not write.
 * The companion guard asserts the walked set equals `classNames()` minus that same
 * dynamic list, so a new wired tool enters here automatically and an exemption
 * cannot be granted silently.
 *
 * A SENTENCE is a run ending in `.`, `!` or `?` followed by whitespace or the end
 * of the string — {@see countSentences()} — the same house counting style used to
 * size the corpus elsewhere. It is deliberately a low bar: three such terminators
 * is the smallest shape that can state what a tool does and what it does not.
