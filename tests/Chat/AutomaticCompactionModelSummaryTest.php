/**
 * crush_code.md Phase 5 item 6, on the tier that actually fires in real use.
 *
 * `/compact` typed by hand already asked the model for its summaries
 * ({@see CompactModelSummaryTest}); the automatic 85% tier did not, and compacted
 * synchronously on the local heuristic instead. That is the LOSSIER of the two
 * and the one nobody elects — sessions fill up on their own — so the exchanges
 * replaced by `[exchanged information]` placeholders were precisely the ones no
 * user chose to condense.
 *
 * The tier now parks the submission behind the summarization round-trip. Four
 * properties carry the whole design and each is driven rather than described:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing is rewritten at park time.** The Cmd carries the provider call;
 *     the transcript still holds every original exchange verbatim.
 *  2. **The turn goes out exactly once, and the prompt is echoed exactly once.**
 *     Counted on a recording backend, not read off the transcript.
 *  3. **The dispatched history never ends on an assistant turn.** A trailing
 *     assistant message is a PREFILL the provider continues, not an instruction
 *     it reads.
 *  4. **With no model to ask, the tier is byte-for-byte what it was.** Same
 *     fixture, no summary backend, same synchronous heuristic.
