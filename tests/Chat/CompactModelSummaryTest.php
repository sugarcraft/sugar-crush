 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and both are asserted behaviourally rather
 * than described:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing blocks.** `/compact` returns a Cmd and rewrites nothing yet. A
 *     synchronous provider call at this point would freeze every keystroke for
 *     the length of a completion, and this codebase deliberately puts no
 *     total-request timeout on one.
 *  2. **No provider is not a failure.** With no summary backend — the offline
 *     default, and what every other test in this suite constructs — `/compact`
 *     is exactly as synchronous and as heuristic as it always was.

     * What this method pinned until this step: that a forged closer travelled into the
     * next request BYTE-INTACT. Its own docblock said the escape that would redden it had
     * to be adjudicated before the expectation moved — R-C's verbatim-carry promise on the
     * table — and the adjudication is this step: R-C is now VERBATIM AT WORDING LEVEL, on
     * the FF1 frame the `COMPACT_SUMMARY_PROMPT` doc-block already states for the transport
     * bound. Escaping rewrites a fence tag's leading `<` and nothing else, so every word a
     * prior round kept still travels, in order and with its spelling, while a tag inside the
     * carried text stops looking like a fence to a reader that tokenises fences.
     *
     * WHY THE ASSERTIONS BELOW ARE THE ONES THAT MATTER, one per way this could be quietly
     * wrong: an escape applied to the WHOLE render (fence and note included) passes every
     * count below while making the block unreadable, so (1) pins the harness opener and the
     * literal tag the merge note teaches; an escape that DROPPED the row instead of defanging
     * it would satisfy every absence-check, so (2) asserts the words are present — §1.10 says
     * a removal is not an outcome even by way of a sanitizer; a defang aimed at the closer
     * only would leave a nested opener to unbalance the block, so (3) pins both polarities
     * inside the carried region and (4) pins the whole-block closer count at exactly one; and
     * (5) pins that the forged pair arrived as escaped TEXT rather than as nothing at all.
     * Per §1.11 both polarities are exact counts, never an absence asserted on a shape.
     *
     * RED-ON-REVERT, executed at this tip and quoted in the step report: deleting the
     * `PromptFence::escape()` call in `Chat::renderPriorSummariesForSummary()` reddens (3)
     * first — the closer count goes 1 → 2 — and nothing else in the suite.
