/**
 * The RETAINED hook-overflow store (P7.S1, ruling R-2), tested where it lives.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing. Two are pinned behaviourally here: the write
 * is private (0600) and leaves no intermediate behind, and the file SURVIVES the
 * hourly IPC sweep (that is the whole difference between this store and {@see
 * ToolIpcFiles} — a retained overflow must still be readable by the model on a
 * later turn). The third, {@see HookContextFiles::bound()} never returning more
 * than the byte cap it is given, is pinned below.
 *
 * ATOMICITY IS NOT BEHAVIOURALLY CLAIMED BY THIS SUITE. `write()`'s temp-then-
 * rename discipline (`src/Support/HookContextFiles.php`) — never leaving a
 * half-written file the consumer reads as whole — is pinned at CODE REVIEW, not
 * here. Reddening on a loss of atomicity would require a same-box crash mid-write
 * probe, which is banned as flaky in this deterministic suite; a post-success
 * absence check cannot distinguish atomic from direct write, so the tests below
 * deliberately make no atomicity promise they could not keep.
