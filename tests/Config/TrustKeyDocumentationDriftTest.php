/**
 * `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` enumerated THREE `trustedProject*` grants for as long
 * as there were four. A page that enumerates trust grants and misses one is
 * worse than no page: a reader who counts three has been told, by a document
 * whose whole job is to be complete, that `trustedProjectSettings` does not
 * exist.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCANS SOURCE TEXT INSTEAD OF READING CONSTANTS. The four keys live
 * in two classes and are declared three different ways: three are
 * `private const` on `Bootstrap`
 * (`TRUSTED_PROJECT_{HOOKS,MCP,COMMANDS}_CONFIG_KEY`), one is
 * {@see LayeredSettings::PROJECT_SETTINGS_TRUST_KEY} and public. Reflection
 * can reach all four — private constants included — but only if this test
 * already knows which two classes to look in, which is precisely the
 * assumption a fifth key added in a THIRD class would break, silently and in
 * the passing direction. A scan over `src/` has no such blind spot.
 *
 * THE THIRD PAGE THIS FAMILY NOW READS: `sugar-crush/README.md`. The two
 * checks at the bottom of this file police the README's key enumerations
 * against {@see LayeredSettings::LAYERED_KEYS} and
 * {@see LayeredSettings::userTierOnlyKeys()} for the same reason the SETTINGS.md
 * rows below are policed rather than proof-read — and because a MEASURED grep
 * showed nothing else did it: `ReadmeRosterDriftTest` never names those two
 * constants, and no test in `tests/` quotes either roster sentence. Both claims
 * in the README were stale on the day `disabledRules` landed, and one of them is
 * the SECURITY enumeration: a reader told "four keys are never taken from a
 * project file" concludes the fifth is project-settable under a trust grant,
 * which is the exact inverse of the tiering decision.
 *
 * WHICH SENTENCE EACH HALF POLICES, because README.md carries spelled-out
 * numbers belonging to several different censuses and a guard must know which
 * one it is reading:
 *
 *  - {@see testTheReadmeLayeredKeyRosterAgreesWithLayeredKeys()} polices the
 *    roster sentence opening "Only these keys are layered —" (the
 *    {@see LayeredSettings::LAYERED_KEYS} enumeration).
 *  - {@see testTheReadmeNamesEveryKeyNoProjectMaySet()} polices the sentence
 *    opening "Even for a trusted project, …keys are **never** taken from a
 *    project file" (the {@see LayeredSettings::userTierOnlyKeys()} enumeration).
 *
 * THE BUILT-IN TOOL CENSUS IS NOT THIS FILE'S JOB. "out of the eleven built-in
 * tools" and the launch-report sample in the same page are numbers about
 * `Bootstrap::tools()`, not about layered keys, and they are already derived by
 * {@see ReadmeSettingsTierClaimTest} (its `SPELLED_COUNTS` map) and by
 * {@see ReadmeRosterDriftTest}. Nothing here reads or constrains either of
 * those, so the two guards cannot disagree about which figure a word stands for.
