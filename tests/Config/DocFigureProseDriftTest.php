/**
 * E633-SLICE-1: a doc-block that quotes measured figures AND draws a
 * qualitative conclusion from them reds instead of rotting.
 *
 * The parent entry's acceptance test is "a mutation of each CONCLUSION, not of
 * the figure underneath it", so each arm below parses the SENTENCE out of the
 * live source and recomputes every number and multiplier it states from the
 * constants it cites — changing a constant, a figure, or the multiplier
 * without the other two reddens here. Scope is the src/ directories no other
 * round-63 lane owns (Support, Skills, Diagnostics; full verdicts and the
 * remainder ledger live in the round-63 E633 notes).
 *
 * VACUITY: every arm asserts its pattern matched before comparing (a deleted
 * claim escapes the pin only by also deleting the test's ability to silently
 * pass), and the two rewritten sentences are themselves pinned as prose —
 * E633's own lesson that an unpinned correction rots back into the claim it
 * corrected.
