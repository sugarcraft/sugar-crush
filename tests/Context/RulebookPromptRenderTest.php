/**
 * The two live renders that prove a `/rules` toggle changes the PROMPT, not merely
 * the object graph.
 *
 * Requirement 9's shape: build the system prompt twice for the SAME pack directory
 * — once with the pack on, once with it toggled off — and compare. Every assertion
 * below is about bytes that reach the model, so a loader that filters correctly but
 * a splice that ignores the filter (or the reverse) cannot pass.
 *
 * WHY THE GOLDEN DOES NOT MOVE. Nothing here touches
 * `tests/fixtures/prompt/golden-system-prompt.txt`, and nothing here needs it to:
 * the packs live in a synthetic `$HOME` under `sys_get_temp_dir()` that the golden's
 * fixture home never contains, so the committed bytes are produced by an input set
 * this file does not modify. That is also why the proof is two renders rather than a
 * third golden — a fixture would have to be regenerated to carry a toggle, and the
 * toggle is the thing being asserted, not a constant to freeze.
 *
 * Each render gets its OWN {@see Runtime}: the prompt is memoised per-Runtime (a
 * §17.2 invariant), so two calls on one instance would return the same string for
 * opposite states and the comparison would be vacuous.
