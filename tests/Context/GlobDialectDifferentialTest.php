/**
 * THE PROOF THAT P6.S5a DID WHAT IT SAID, in both directions.
 *
 * P6.S5a reduced three path-matching dialects to one compiler
 * ({@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Util\PathGlob}) and routed both production matchers
 * through it. That claim has two halves and they need opposite evidence.
 *
 * THE LIVE HALF. `SkillRegistry::pathMatches()` answers on a tool-call path, so
 * its YES-set must not have moved by even one path. Proved by an equivalence
 * harness: a FROZEN TRANSCRIPTION of the master implementation, compiled into
 * this class, answers side by side with the shipped code over a corpus derived
 * from the repository's own globs, and the two agree on every pair — including
 * the compiled regexes themselves, which is the stronger claim, because two
 * regexes can agree on a corpus and disagree on the next path. The comparison
 * count is asserted and not quoted: a zero-difference claim with no measured
 * corpus is not evidence.
 *
 * THE DELIBERATE HALF. `PathTrigger` spoke the stricter dialect and its answer
 * WAS meant to move. Pinned row by row against the premise check's 33-row
 * differential, with the moved rows derived from a second frozen transcription
 * (the deleted strict compiler) rather than typed: ten rows widen, three narrow,
 * twenty hold. The three narrowings are named in
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\Triggers\PathTrigger}'s doc-block and are not
 * glossed here either.
 *
 * WHY THE THIRTEEN AND NOT THE ELEVEN. The premise check's header, its Q7, and
 * the step brief all say ELEVEN rows disagree. MEASURED on `master` at
 * `f3134703f` through the two transcriptions this file carries, the figure is
 * THIRTEEN — rows 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 26, 30 and 32 — while
 * every one of the table's 33 printed per-row answers reproduces exactly. The
 * header and the row data disagreed with each other; the row data is what the
 * tree says. {@see testTheRowsThatMoveAreThirteenAndNotEleven()} derives the
 * figure from the table instead of typing it, so this paragraph cannot go stale
 * without reddening.
 *
 * WHY AN ORACLE IS A TRANSCRIPTION AND NOT A CALL. An oracle that reached the
 * code under test would agree with it by construction. So both master compilers
 * are reproduced below as private methods, byte for byte apart from their names,
 * and each is kept honest by {@see testEachFrozenOracleStillAnswersThePairItWas
 * TakenFor()} — an edit to an oracle cannot quietly turn the harness into a
 * tautology while those discriminating pairs still hold.
 *
 * THE ONE HOLE IN "ONE DIALECT", and it is a policy hole rather than a dialect
 * hole: {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Skills\SkillRegistry::legacyPathMatch()} answers
 * the globs this compiler cannot compile, and `fnmatch()` refuses a subject
 * holding a NUL byte outright. On that input the skill channel propagates a
 * `ValueError` where the rule trigger answers no match. Both polarities are
 * pinned, and the corpus-wide test asserts that NOTHING ELSE separates the two
 * matchers any more.
