/**
 * P11.S2-pin: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "The system prompt, in assembly order"
 * section is PROSE that restates a CODE fact — the exact slot order of
 * {@see Runtime::systemPromptSections()} — and prose without a generator rots
 * (the same argument GlobFigureDriftTest makes about character counts). The
 * P11.S2 step rewrote the page to the eleven slots shipped since P9.S1; a
 * manual check was recorded in the worklog, but the plan's done-when also says
 * "if a cheap assertion can pin it, add one", and ARCHITECTURE.md carries zero
 * derived guards today. This file is that guard: it drives the REAL private
 * assembler, classifies every produced section into one token per documented
 * slot, parses the numbered list out of the page, and asserts the two
 * sequences are equal in membership AND position.
 *
 * WHY SECTION OBJECTS AND NOT THE FOLDED STRING:
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Runtime::assembleSections()} folds empty renders
 * away, so a byte-position probe cannot see a slot that is present in the
 * ordered list yet renders '' for this App — and the documented fact is about
 * the LIST ("returns the prompt as an ordered list of sections — eleven
 * slots"). SystemPromptWiringTest's fixture-order test already pins string
 * positions of the non-empty halves; this file pins the list itself, against
 * the page, which nothing else does.
 *
 * BOTH SIDES CAN RED THE TEST, AND EACH FAILURE MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
 * If a section class or fence is renamed, the classifier drops the section
 * into its fail-with-diagnostic default and says which bytes it could not
 * place. If a doc item is renumbered, reworded away from its anchor needle,
 * or reordered against the code, the needle or sequence assertion names the
 * item number and the expected wording. A section ADDED to the assembler
 * without a doc row lands on the uncategorized default too, because the
 * App below wires every optional slot, so the live sequence must have an
 * equal number of members to pass.
 *
 * The mapping between prose labels and code identities lives in
 * {@see self::DOC_SLOT_PINS} as an explicit table — doc item number to section
 * token to the needle the item's own text must still contain — so the pin is
 * readable as the sentence it enforces rather than as an anonymous array.
 *
 * No golden bytes are produced here: the test reads the section LIST and the
 * markdown file, never the assembled prompt string, so a dirty working tree
 * cannot move any assertion (the law-4h concern that keeps prompt-render
 * suites for committed states only does not apply to a list-shape probe).
