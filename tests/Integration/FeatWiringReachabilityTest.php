/**
 * Reachability tests for crush_feat.md's Executive Summary table of
 * subsystems that were "fully built, fully tested, never wired into the live
 * app". Each test here proves a subsystem is reachable FROM the real
 * `bin/sugarcrush` construction chain — `Bootstrap::app()` /
 * `Bootstrap::chat()` — rather than merely that its class works in isolation,
 * which is exactly the failure mode the audit found: every one of these had
 * green unit tests while being a guaranteed no-op in production.
 *
 * The bin script itself cannot be driven from a test (it ends in
 * `Program::run()`, which attaches to a real TTY and blocks), so the entry
 * point under test is `Bootstrap`, the construction logic that script's IIFE
 * was extracted into — the same reasoning {@see BinSugarcrushWiringTest}
 * documents.
 *
 * Rows covered here (W4.S1a): the session store, session tabs, and background
 * sessions. (W4.S1b): the Skills subsystem. (W4.S1c): candy-mouse/candy-zone.
 * Later sub-steps extend this class with the remaining rows.
