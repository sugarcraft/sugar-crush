/**
 * P6.S5b end to end: a `paths:`-scoped rule leaves the standing prompt and
 * arrives on the tool result of the call that touches a path it claims.
 *
 * Three things are asserted here that no unit test of
 * {@see RulePathNudge} can see, and each is a defect this step could ship while
 * staying green in its own file:
 *
 *  1. the splice actually withholds the rule (a tracker nobody consults and a
 *     splice that still renders would double-present every scoped body — the
 *     P7.S3 double-presentation failure mode, previously closed by a -97 B
 *     golden move);
 *  2. `Bootstrap::tools()` really hands ONE tracker to all five path-resolving
 *     tools, derived from the tools that declare the property rather than from a
 *     hand-kept list, because a hand-kept list is exactly what let the skills
 *     channel ship `Write` unwired;
 *  3. every budget a shipped tool passes can hold a worst-case nudge, priced
 *     from the tool source and the tracker's own derived ceiling rather than
 *     from a number copied into this file.
 *
 * A FOURTH joined them with the follow-up that threaded the session's rulebook
 * toggle set into the tracker: a pack the operator silenced must be off the
 * transient channel as well as off the splice, and no unit test can see whether
 * `chat()`'s instance actually survived the boot path to the object the shipped
 * tools hold. Section 5 below asserts that threading — identity first, behaviour
 * second — plus the polarity that a boot passing no set keeps the older shape.
 *
 * The rule files live in a synthetic `$HOME` and a synthetic repo under
 * `sys_get_temp_dir()`, never under `tests/fixtures/prompt/home`: the golden
 * fixture materialiser returns early when its rule file already exists, so a
 * committed fixture rule is silently NOT delivered on a warm `vendor/` tree, and
 * a test written against one would be green forever while proving nothing.
