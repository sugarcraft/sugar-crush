/**
 * P11.S4 — the only end-to-end proof that the production-assembled BLOCK arm
 * of the system prompt reaches the provider wire from a real keystroke turn.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: another record-then-assert test. The provider-level block
 * tests (e.g. `tests/Providers/SystemPromptTransmissionMatrixTest.php`) build
 * `new CompleteRequest(...)` BY HAND with synthetic blocks, which proves the
 * transmitters honour the shape but says nothing about whether production ever
 * FILLS it. And the keystroke test next door,
 * {@see SystemPromptWiringTest::testARealChatKeystrokeTurnDeliversBothHalves()},
 * crosses the same fork with a provider that echoes only the FLAT string — so
 * until this class existed, no test had ever asserted `systemBlocks` on a
 * request that crossed `EngineBackend::completeAsync()` end to end.
 *
 * WHY THE ECHO ENVELOPE AND NOT A CAPTURE (measured at base 8e822c6ed):
 * `completeAsync()` runs the turn inside a `pcntl_fork()` child whenever the
 * extension is present (this box: `function_exists('pcntl_fork')` is true), and
 * a provider that merely records requests records them in the child, whose
 * memory dies with the child. PROBE MEASUREMENT: an anonymous capturing
 * provider driven through one full `Chat::update(Enter)` turn returned an empty
 * `requests` array in the parent after the turn completed with its canned
 * answer — zero observations of the wire. The provider here instead serialises
 * the real request facts (hasBlocks flag, flat prompt, base64 block list) into
 * the response CONTENT, because the returned Message is the only channel that
 * crosses the boundary back to the parent (length-prefixed `serialize()`
 * frames; base64 keeps the block structure byte-exact inside JSON). On a box
 * without pcntl, `completeAsyncBlocking()` runs the same chain in-parent and
 * the envelope still round-trips — the chosen shape observes the wire either way.
 *
 * THE PLAN'S PREMISE, STATED PLAINLY (§P11.S4 "Done when"): this test would
 * have FAILED on the pre-Phase-11 tree, and it fails for a structural reason,
 * not an incidental one. The block arm itself only arrived with P10.S1:
 * `Runtime::run()` gained the two-arm fold
 * `[$systemPrompt, $systemBlocks] = self::assembleSections(...)` at that step,
 * and before it `CompleteRequest::$systemBlocks` was always null — assertion
 * (a) below is the one that goes red first. Every LAYER the needle set (d)
 * checks pre-dates Phase 11: env-last is P3.S1, maxims are P5.S5, the rules
 * fences are P6.S2, the skill-body splice and listing exclusion are P7.S3, the
 * tool-guidance seam is P9.S1, the block arm is P10.S1. So the layers are old
 * news; what is new is that they are asserted to reach the wire as STRUCTURE —
 * ordered blocks with the fold identity intact — out of a keystroke, which is
 * exactly the guarantee P10.S1 was for.
 *
 * Layer count of record: the plan text says "seven layers"; the section list at
 * this base carries eleven slots (base, maxims, tool-guidance-if-non-empty,
 * repo-map, user-tier rules, instruction docs, project-tier rules, memory,
 * enabled-skill bodies, skill listing, env). This sandbox makes every slot
 * non-empty except the project-tier rules one, and `assembleSections()` folds
 * empty renders out of BOTH arms — so the assertions here are presence-,
 * identity- and order-based, never cardinality-based, and hold whichever way a
 * run's cwd happens to flip that one tier.
