/**
 * `SkillRegistry::$compiledPathPatterns` used to be an unbounded static cache
 * (E99), and the bound everyone reasoned from was a property of its callers.
 *
 * THE OLD REASONING, AND WHY IT WAS NOT A BOUND. The doc-block said the pattern
 * set is "bounded by the skills installed on the box", which is TRUE of every
 * caller in `src/` today — the only production route into
 * {@see SkillRegistry::pathMatches()} is `getForPaths()`, iterating each
 * registered skill's frontmatter `paths:`. But `pathMatches()` is `public
 * static`. A `/skill` verb taking a glob, or a user-supplied `paths:` filter,
 * would feed it distinct patterns per request, and the cache would grow for the
 * life of the process with nothing to stop it. A convention is not a bound.
 *
 * THE DECISION, AND THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS MEASURED AND REJECTED. "Drop the
 * memo" is the other way to bound this, and it does not survive contact with a
 * measurement: the translation is a character walk at ~1.46 us against ~0.17 us
 * for the match it feeds, so removing the cache makes this matcher 8.5x slower
 * — slower than the `str_replace` predicate it replaced. The generator and the
 * three-run figures are on `$compiledPathPatterns`. So: a cap, set high enough
 * that no real skill roster can reach it, with an empty-and-refill eviction.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PINS.
 *  - The cap is enforced, not merely declared.
 *  - The cap is far above the shipped roster, DERIVED from that roster rather
 *    than compared against a number typed here — so a tree that grew 300 skills
 *    finds out from this test rather than from a memory graph.
 *  - The hit path still caches, which is the property the cap must not have
 *    cost. (`SkillPathPatternTest::testTheCompiledPatternIsCachedUnderItsRawPattern()`
 *    asserts the same thing from the other end and is deliberately left alone.)
 *  - {@see SkillRegistry::legacyPathMatch()} is STILL REACHABLE after the
 *    rewrite. This is the one that would otherwise rot quietly: the fallback is
 *    reached only through an uncompilable pattern, and a change to the lookup
 *    around `compilePathPattern()` is exactly the sort of edit that could route
 *    every pattern to a compiled regex and leave an unpinnable method behind.
 *
 * THE CACHE IS SHARED PROCESS STATE, so every test here saves and restores it
 * rather than clearing it. A sibling test that had warmed a pattern must find
 * it warm afterwards.
