/**
 * The settings-file layers behind {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::readUserConfig()}.
 *
 * Until this class there was ONE settings file — `~/.sugar-crush/config.json` —
 * and a project had no way to say anything at all. The layers now are, LOWEST
 * PRECEDENCE FIRST:
 *
 *   1. `<root>/.sugar-crush/settings.json`       project, meant to be committed
 *   2. `<root>/.sugar-crush/settings.local.json` project, meant to be ignored
 *   3. `~/.sugar-crush/settings.json`            user, hand-authored
 *   4. `~/.sugar-crush/config.json`              user, WRITTEN BY THE CLI
 *
 * Merged key by key, highest present key wins. Two rules make that ordering
 * statable in one sentence each, and both are choices with a cost:
 *
 * THE USER'S FILES OUTRANK THE PROJECT'S — the reverse of the convention most
 * editors use, where a project overrides a user. Taken deliberately: layer 1
 * ARRIVED WITH A CLONE. If the project outranked the user, a checkout could
 * change a setting the user had already made for themselves, and the user's own
 * file would look broken. Here a project can only fill in what the user left
 * unsaid, which is the whole of what a project legitimately knows.
 *
 * `config.json` OUTRANKS `settings.json`, and it is the OLDER of the two names
 * rather than a deprecated one — nothing in `src/` marks it deprecated, and it
 * is still the file the CLI writes, so calling it deprecated (as an earlier
 * version of this paragraph did) tells a reader to migrate off the only file
 * that gets written. It is the file
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::writeUserConfig()} writes, and
 * EXACTLY TWO KEYS reach it: `provider` and `theme`. Those are the two values
 * `onConfigChange` is ever invoked with, and EACH HAS TWO PRODUCERS — a
 * palette row and a slash command:
 *
 *  - `provider`: the Ctrl+P palette's "Switch Model" row, and `/model <name>`.
 *  - `theme`:    the Ctrl+P palette's "Switch Theme" row, and `/theme <name>`.
 *
 * AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS SENTENCE CREDITED THE PALETTE ALONE FOR
 * `provider`, and the omission is the interesting half rather than a typo.
 * WHAT IT SAID: "`provider`, from the Ctrl+P palette's 'Switch Model' action".
 * WHAT IS TRUE NOW: `/model <name>` reaches the identical write. FOLLOWED, not
 * inferred: {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Chat}'s `handleModelCommand()` ends in
 * `selectPaletteProvider($args[0])`, and `selectPaletteProvider()` is the sole
 * site that calls `$onConfigChange('provider', …)` — the palette row and the
 * command are not two writers, they are one writer with two doors. WHY THIS
 * STILL EARNS ITS PLACE: the palette is still the discoverable door, and a
 * reader who only ever presses Ctrl+P is not misled by naming it first. What
 * the old wording cost was the reader hunting for where a `/model` choice went,
 * on a page that had just told them exhaustively which keys are written.
 * `README.md`'s layer table already credited `/model`; two documents disagreed
 * and the less-read one was right. Pinned by
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Config\ConfigWriteProducerDocumentationDriftTest}.
 *
 * No MODEL is persisted by any of the four — the palette row is named for what
 * a user thinks they are choosing, not for the key it writes.
 *
 * Ranked the other way round, a `settings.json` that names `theme` would break
 * PERSISTENCE, not the visible command, and the distinction is the whole
 * diagnosis. MEASURED on PHP 8.3.6 on 2026-08-22 (8.4 was NOT exercised on this
 * box; nothing in the path is believed version-sensitive): `/theme dracula`
 * against a `Chat` constructed with `themeName: 'dark'` returns a `Chat` whose
 * `theme()->name` is already `dracula` — `/theme` mutates the live `Chat`, so
 * it repaints at once whatever any file says — and fires
 * `onConfigChange('theme', 'dracula')` in the same update. Only the NEXT launch
 * reads the merge, so under the reversed ordering the session would repaint,
 * then silently revert, with no error anywhere and nothing in the UI pointing
 * at the file responsible. AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS PARAGRAPH said every
 * `/theme` would "appear to do nothing", which is the coarser and wrong
 * version: it sends a reader looking for a broken command instead of a
 * settings file. It is rewritten rather than dropped because the CONCLUSION it
 * reached is still the right one — the file that WRITES has to be the file
 * that DECIDES — and a reader who finds only the conclusion re-derives the
 * wrong reason for it. `docs/SETTINGS.md` carried the persistence framing
 * first; this is the doc-block catching up. Pinned by
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Config\ThemePersistenceFramingTest}.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT LAYERED, and this is the security boundary rather than a scoping
 * shortcut: any key absent from {@see LAYERED_KEYS} is answered by layer 4
 * ALONE, exactly as before this class existed. So `permissionMode`,
 * `permissionRules`, `trustedProjectHooks`, `trustedProjectMcp`,
 * `trustedProjectCommands` and {@see PROJECT_SETTINGS_TRUST_KEY} itself cannot
 * be written, weakened or self-granted from any lower layer — a project cannot
 * add itself to the list of trusted projects.
 *
 * `permissionMode`/`permissionRules` being absent from {@see LAYERED_KEYS} does
 * NOT mean they are unreadable from `~/.sugar-crush/settings.json`: they are, as
 * of Phase 6 item 4. It means they do not come through THIS class, whose reader
 * is deliberately tolerant. {@see LAYERED_KEYS} carries the full argument.
 *
 * The whitelist is also why nothing decorative can slip
 * in: every key in it is named by a real reader, cited on
 * {@see LAYERED_KEYS}, and a key nothing reads is worse than a missing one
 * because it looks configurable.
 *
 * RE-READ EVERY TURN, unlike the trust list that gates it, and the asymmetry is
 * worth knowing before relying on either. `EngineBackend` calls
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::readUserConfig()} once per turn, so
 * all four files are opened again each time: MEASURED, writing
 * `.sugar-crush/settings.local.json` mid-session flips `disabledSkills` on the
 * next turn. The TRUST list is frozen per process
 * ({@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::$trustedSettingsRoots}), so a
 * project cannot become trusted mid-session — but once it is trusted, a tool
 * call inside a turn can change what its own next turn reads. Defensible,
 * because the operator opted this repository in and the project tier cannot
 * reach `provider`, `instructions` or any permission key; stated because
 * "trusted, frozen" would otherwise read as covering both.
 *
 * `.sugar-crush/settings.local.json` GETS THE SAME GATE AS THE TRACKED FILE,
 * which is worth stating because the convention says "local" and `.gitignore`
 * says it is not committed. Neither is a property of a repository someone else
 * wrote: `.gitignore` is advice to the committer, `git add -f` overrides it,
 * and a hostile checkout can therefore ship a `settings.local.json` as readily
 * as a `settings.json`. The two differ in PRECEDENCE only. Treating "local" as
 * "mine, therefore trusted" would have been the whole gate defeated by a
 * filename.

     *                 silence, since {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\RulesState}'s
     *                 `TOGGLEABLE_TIER` is `'user'` — the argument is below.
     *  - `parallelToolCalls` / `parallelToolDeadlineSeconds`
     *                 {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Backend\EngineBackend}'s per-turn

     *  - `allowedTools` / `disabledTools`
     *                 {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::tools()}, which
     *                 filters the model-facing tool set before any of its three
     *                 `withTools()` call sites sees it.
     *  - `statusLine` {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Config\StatusLineCommand::fromSettings()},
     *                 installed by `Bootstrap::chat()` and painted by
     *                 {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Renderer::renderStatusBar()}.
     *
     * `statusLine` IS THE ONLY KEY HERE WHOSE VALUE IS A COMMAND, and that is
     * why it is user-tier only ({@see PROJECT_TIER_KEYS} does not list it).
     * Every other key on this list names a preference, a model, a glob or a
     * tool name — a value some later reader interprets. This one names a shell
     * command that {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Config\StatusLineCommand::run()}
     * executes on a timer, with no tool call and no permission gate anywhere
     * in the path. The argument `provider` and `instructions` make below
     * applies here in its strongest form: a project-tier `statusLine` would be
     * arbitrary code execution on clone-and-launch. Those two let a checkout
     * choose where a prompt is sent and which text is authoritative; this one
     * would let it choose what RUNS.
     *
     * It is a NESTED object — `{"type": "command", "command": "…"}` — which is
     * the shape the `allowedTools`/`disabledTools` note below says was refused
     * for the tool keys, so the difference is worth stating rather than
     * looking like an inconsistency. That refusal is about {@see merge()}
     * being KEY-WISE across TIERS: `tools.allow` and `tools.deny` belong to
     * different tiers, so one key could not carry both. `statusLine`'s two
     * fields belong to the SAME tier and are meaningless apart — a `type` with
     * no `command` runs nothing — so there is no merge for them to lose. The
     * shape is also Claude Code's, which is what makes a `settings.json`
     * written for that tool carry over unchanged.
     *
     * `allowedTools` / `disabledTools`, NOT a nested `tools: {allow, deny}`,
     * and the shape is forced rather than chosen: {@see merge()} is KEY-WISE,
     * so a single `tools` key would be replaced whole by whichever layer set it
     * — and the two halves belong to DIFFERENT TIERS
     * ({@see PROJECT_TIER_KEYS} takes `disabledTools` and refuses
     * `allowedTools`). Nested under one key, a project's `tools.deny` and a
     * user's `tools.allow` could not coexist, and gating one half without the
     * other would be unexpressible. The spelling follows `disabledSkills`,
     * which is the same idea one layer up.
     *
     * `disabledRules` LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD FOLLOW `disabledSkills` AND IT DOES
     * NOT, so the difference is stated here rather than left for a reviewer to
     * ask about. Both are disable-lists, and a disable-list holds NAMES, not
     * contents — so the `instructions` argument ("its file contents become
     * prompt text", {@see userTierOnlyKeys()}) cannot decide this one either
     * way on its own. What decides it is what the names SELECT: `disabledSkills`
     * subtracts from a capability set the harness enforces, and "this repo has
     * no use for the terraform skill" is a thing the checkout genuinely knows
     * better than the operator. A rule pack is the OPERATOR'S OWN PROMPT TEXT —
     * the user tier's `rules/` and `rulebooks/` directories — and
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\RulesState} draws the same line from the
     * other side: `TOGGLEABLE_TIER` is `'user'`, so not even the interactive
     * `/rules` command may silence a repository-authored pack. A project value
     * here would be a checkout silencing prose the operator wrote about their
     * own working style, under a trust grant whose stated meaning is "start my
     * servers and pick my theme".
     *
     * NO PERMISSION KEY HERE, and this is the one omission a reader of Phase 6
     * item 4 will come looking for. `permissionMode` and `permissionRules` ARE
     * readable from `~/.sugar-crush/settings.json` as of that item — but NOT
     * through this class, because this class's reader is TOLERANT by contract
     * (a malformed file is the absence of a layer, {@see readFile()}) and the
     * permission path may not be: `Bootstrap::permissionGate()` refuses to
     * start on a policy file it cannot parse, precisely so a stray comma cannot
     * silently downgrade a session to the permissive default. Routing the
     * permission keys through {@see merge()} would have handed them that
     * tolerance. They are read instead by
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::permissionSettingsLayer()},
     * which applies the strict reader to the same user-tier file and no project
     * file at all, and whose result `Bootstrap::permissionConfigLayers()` puts
     * BENEATH `config.json`. (`permissionPolicy()` is what this line said
     * before, and no such method has ever existed — a `{@see}` naming a symbol
     * that is not there is the same defect as a decorative config key, one
     * layer up: it reads as a reader and is not one.) Listing these keys here
     * would have been the opposite of the no-decorative-surface rule: a key
     * with a reader that ignores it.
     *
     * NO `model` KEY, deliberately, and it is the one name a reader expects to
     * find here. Nothing reads a top-level `model` out of the user config:
     * `Subcommands::models()`'s `$config['model']` is a PROVIDER config out of
     * `Bootstrap::availableProviders()`, and the two model-shaped user keys that
     * do exist are the two named above. Adding `model` would have been surface
     * with no reader — configurable-looking and inert.

     * questions and the second one has a different answer per key:
     *
     *  - `theme` is pixels.

     *    already chose, on the user's own credential and endpoint. The cost of a
     *    hostile value is tokens and a wrong title.
     *  - `disabledSkills` REMOVES a capability rather than adding one, and "this
     *    repo has no use for the terraform skill" is the archetypal thing a
     *    repository knows and a user does not. Gated all the same, because
     *    removing a capability can also mean removing a check the user relies on.
     *  - `parallelToolCalls` / `parallelToolDeadlineSeconds` are throughput. A
     *    repository whose test suite serialises badly has a real reason.
     *  - `disabledTools` names tools to REMOVE from the set
     *    {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::tools()} built, which is the
     *    `disabledSkills` argument one layer down: "there is no MCP server in
     *    this checkout, stop offering WebSearch" is a thing a repository knows.
     *    Gated for `disabledSkills`' reason too — removing a capability can
     *    remove a check — and it CANNOT widen anything, because that set is the
     *    ceiling and both tool keys only ever shrink it.
     *
     * `allowedTools` IS ABSENT, and it is the interesting one, because on
     * capability alone it looks as safe as its sibling: a whitelist intersected
     * with an existing set cannot add a tool either. Two reasons it is still
     * user-tier only.
     *
     * First, a whitelist's effect is defined by what it OMITS, so it is the one
     * shape in which a small, innocuous-looking value deletes almost
     * everything. In one line, `allowedTools: ["Bash"]` removes ALL TEN of the
     * others: `Read`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Write`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`,
     * `doctor`, `Skill` and `Lsp`. (This sentence named five of the ten. The
     * `doctor` is lower-case — matching is case-sensitive `fnmatch()`, so the
     * capitalised spelling matches no tool.) And what the model does next is
     * not "less work", it is the SAME work through `Bash`, which reaches the
     * permission gate as opaque shell text instead of as a reviewable path.
     * That is a privilege escalation by degradation: strictly fewer tools,
     * strictly coarser review.
     *
     * AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS PARAGRAPH ENDED WITH A FALSE CLAIM, and it is
     * corrected here rather than deleted because it was the stated reason for
     * the tiering: it said `disabledTools` "can express the same attack, but
     * only by naming every tool it removes, which is a value an operator
     * reading the file can see". It cannot be relied on.
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::filterToolSet()} matches with
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Permissions\PermissionRule::matchesToolName()},
     * which is bare `fnmatch()`, and `fnmatch()` honours NEGATED character
     * classes. MEASURED end-to-end on PHP 8.3.6, 2026-08-22 — PHP 8.4 was NOT
     * exercised, because this box has only 8.3.6 while CI runs both; nothing in
     * this path is believed version-sensitive (`fnmatch()`'s `[!…]` is not a
     * recent addition and no ICU is involved), and the version is recorded as
     * provenance rather than as a caveat. A project-tier
     * `{"disabledTools": ["[!B]*"]}` — FIVE characters of glob, in one key this
     * tier is allowed — leaves exactly `Bash` and removes everything else,
     * which is the same tool set `allowedTools: ["Bash"]` produces.
     *
     * THE COUNT SAID "eight characters" until `docs/SETTINGS.md` re-derived it,
     * and this doc-block was named there as one of the two places still
     * carrying the stale figure. WHAT IT SAID: eight. WHAT IS TRUE NOW: `[!B]*`
     * is five, `"[!B]*"` seven and `["[!B]*"]` nine — nothing in the example is
     * eight. WHY THE SENTENCE STILL EARNS ITS PLACE: the number was never the
     * argument. The point is that a value this short names NONE of the ten
     * tools it removes, which is exactly the auditability the retracted claim
     * promised, so the sentence is corrected rather than dropped.
     *
     * AND THE CORRECTION ONCE CITED THE WRONG GENERATOR, which is worth more
     * space than the number was. WHAT IT SAID: the figure "is re-derived every
     * run by `ReadmeSettingsTierClaimTest::testOneShortDenyGlobRemovesEveryToolButOneWithoutNamingAnyOfThem()`,
     * so it reds instead of rotting". WHAT IS TRUE NOW: that test derives the
     * TOOL SET this glob leaves. It never measures the glob's LENGTH — the glob
     * is a class constant there, and no `strlen()` in `tests/` is applied to it
     * (VERIFIED at `8416d98e`, and again at round 44 with the command the
     * sentence used to omit — `grep -rl 'strlen(' tests --include='*.php'`,
     * cross-checked against the looser `grep -rl 'strlen'`: no file either
     * command reports applies it to `COUNTEREXAMPLE_GLOB` or to any spelling
     * of `[!B]*`. An earlier draft said "no `strlen()` appears anywhere in
     * `tests/`", which is plainly false and is corrected here rather than
     * dropped, since a doc-block that catches a false claim by writing a second
     * one has learnt nothing) — so the citation was a number written down
     * beside the name of something that does not produce it.
     *
     * AND THE REPAIR CARRIED TWO CARDINALITIES THAT WERE STALE BEFORE THE ROUND
     * CLOSED. WHAT IT SAID: those two commands "count 66 files and 68". WHAT IS
     * TRUE NOW: 71 and 73 at `98d59bfb`. Both were right when round 44's lane
     * `a` measured them in its own worktree, and both were wrong by the time
     * that worktree merged, because two sibling lanes added test files
     * containing `strlen` in the same round. WHY THIS STILL EARNS ITS PLACE:
     * the claim the paragraph actually makes is a NEGATIVE — that no such call
     * reaches this constant — and that survived the merge untouched. The
     * cardinalities never supported it; they only looked like evidence. A count
     * taken over `tests/` in one lane's worktree is invalidated by any sibling
     * lane's merge, so the generator is kept and the two totals are dropped
     * rather than re-derived into the next round's staleness. This is E131.
     *
     * THE MEASUREMENT OFFERED IN ITS PLACE HAD NO GENERATOR EITHER, and it is
     * rewritten for the same reason. WHAT IT SAID: on PHP 8.3.6, restoring
     * "eight" to this very paragraph left that test and its five sibling
     * doc-drift suites at `OK (80 tests, 297 assertions)`. WHAT IS TRUE NOW: no
     * command in the tree produces that pair. The nearest reproducible

     * deliberately not quoted, because widening the census scope moved it by
     * tens of thousands inside a single commit. WHY THE SENTENCE STILL EARNS
     * ITS PLACE: the OBSERVATION reproduces even though the figure does not,
     * and it is the entire reason the generator below exists — the stale figure
     * could be put back inside the sentence claiming it could not, and nothing
     * went red. It goes red now.
     *
     * THE COUNT HAS A GENERATOR AT LAST.
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Config\GlobFigureDriftTest} derives every
     * number in this paragraph from `strlen()` of the glob the paragraph
     * quotes, at all THREE sites that carry the retraction — this doc-block,
     * `docs/SETTINGS.md` and
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::reportProjectTierToolRemovals()} —
     * and the spelled length in the paragraph above at the two sites that spell
     * one. (This said "on both pages that carry it" while its own generator
     * already listed three: `Bootstrap` joined in round 44, the sentence did
     * not, and the phrase naming the spelled count is deliberately not repeated
     * here — the generator locates that paragraph by those very words, and a
     * second copy of them makes its window ambiguous. It reds on that, which is
     * how this sentence was caught.)
     * The BEHAVIOUR — that this value leaves exactly `Bash` — is the half
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Config\ReadmeSettingsTierClaimTest::testOneShortDenyGlobRemovesEveryToolButOneWithoutNamingAnyOfThem()}
     * generates, and the two are not interchangeable.
     *
     * `Bootstrap::reportProjectTierToolRemovals()` WAS THE OTHER SITE, AND THIS
     * PARAGRAPH WAS WRONG ABOUT IT IN THREE WAYS AT ONCE. WHAT IT SAID: that
     * Bootstrap "is the other site `SETTINGS.md` named"; that its being the
     * ONLY remaining one was itself asserted; and that the assertion was a
     * `GlobFigureDriftTest` method named for the settings page naming exactly
     * the source files that still carried the stale figure. (That method name
     * is DESCRIBED here rather than spelled, and deliberately: a phantom
     * symbol written in citation form is indistinguishable — to a reader and
     * to {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\SymbolCitationDriftTest} alike — from
     * a citation that resolves, which is the whole subject of this paragraph.
     * Do not "restore" the literal name; quoting a dead symbol in citation
     * form is the defect, not the record of it.)
     * WHAT IS TRUE NOW: `SETTINGS.md` names no sites at all — it states a
     * CARDINALITY instead, because a list of filenames is exactly what went
     * stale in round 43; the number of sites still carrying the figure is ZERO,
     * `Bootstrap` having been rewritten in round 44; and no test method
     * answering that description exists TODAY — one was declared at
     * `4ba28fe3f` and removed at `579a6bf15`, the commit that emptied the
     * census and wrote a differently-named successor, which `1f10b6224` then
     * renamed to today's
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Config\GlobFigureDriftTest::testNothingInScopeStillCarriesTheStaleFigureAndTheSettingsPageAgrees()}.
     * (The earlier claim here read "has ever existed", which is false in the
     * direction that matters: the symbol WAS real, which is exactly why a
     * reader would try to restore it. The shas above are the record, and
     * they are shas rather than a name for the reason the parenthesis above
     * gives.) All three sentences
     * were falsified by the commit that wrote them. WHY THIS STILL EARNS ITS
     * PLACE: the cross-reference is the only thing telling a reader that the
     * claim above is checked rather than proof-read, and a DANGLING one is
     * worse than none, because it reads as a citation and resolves to nothing.
     * That failure has its own guard now:
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\SymbolCitationDriftTest} reds when `src/`
     * or `docs/` cites a test symbol that does not exist, and this paragraph is
     * the defect it was built from.
     *
     * So the shape argument DOES NOT survive on its own, and the honest
     * statement of where this key stands is: a project-tier `disabledTools`
     * glob CAN reduce the model to a single tool of the project's choosing,
     * and the second reason below is what the split actually rests on.
     *
     * TWO THINGS NARROW IT, both measured and neither previously written down.
     * An UNTRUSTED project's `disabledTools` never reaches the merge at all, so
     * this needs the operator's own {@see PROJECT_SETTINGS_TRUST_KEY} grant
     * first. And {@see merge()} is KEY-LEVEL rather than a union, so a user who
     * names any `disabledTools` of their own REPLACES the project's list
     * outright: a user `["Read"]` against a project `["[!B]*"]` removes exactly
     * `Read`. The gap is open only for an operator who trusted a repository and
     * set no `disabledTools` themselves.
     *
     * THAT CAPABILITY IS STILL THERE. What changed is that it is no longer
     * SILENT: {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::reportProjectTierToolRemovals()}
     * reports a trusted project's tool removals at launch, naming this file,
     * the tools it took and the tools it left. Neither of the two restrictions
     * this comment used to propose was taken, and the measurement is why —
     * refusing negated classes closes `[!B]*` and not `["[C-Z]*", "[a-z]*"]`,
     * which is the same attack without a negation, and restricting the tier to
     * literal names would delete the `mcp__git__*` use the key was admitted
     * for. Reaching any of this requires the operator to have listed the
     * checkout under {@see PROJECT_SETTINGS_TRUST_KEY} first, so the property
     * worth restoring was the auditability the quoted claim promised, not the
     * grammar it was reasoning about.
     *
     * Second, a whitelist is what a user reaches for when they want a CEILING,
     * and a ceiling a checkout can rewrite is not one. What makes that hold when
     * both keys are in play is not an ordering:
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::filterToolSet()} keeps a tool iff
     * the allow-list admits it AND the deny-list does not name it — one
     * conjunction, no stages — so there is no later step in which a project's
     * `disabledTools` could re-admit what the user's `allowedTools` excluded.

     * DERIVED, not written out, so the two lists above cannot drift apart into a

     * `instructions`, `disabledRules`, `allowedTools` and `statusLine`, in
     * {@see LAYERED_KEYS} order — named rather than numbered here, because the
     * ordinals this sentence used to carry went stale the moment a fifth key
     * joined the list. `allowedTools`'s argument is on {@see PROJECT_TIER_KEYS},
     * next to the sibling key that IS allowed, since that is where the two have
     * to be compared; `statusLine`'s is on {@see LAYERED_KEYS}, because what
     * makes it user-tier is not a comparison with anything on this list — it is
     * the only key whose value is a COMMAND. `disabledRules`'s is on
     * {@see LAYERED_KEYS} too, against its lookalike `disabledSkills`, and the
     * short form of it is that the value holds pack NAMES whose referents are the
     * operator's own prompt text, so the "file contents become prompt text"
     * wording below does not decide it — what decides it is
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\RulesState::TOGGLEABLE_TIER}: a session may
     * silence a user pack and no session may silence a repository one, so a
     * checkout choosing which user packs are off is outside the grant even
     * "I trust this repository" does not make.
     * The set is asserted, not believed, by
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Config\LayeredSettingsTest::testTheUserTierOnlyKeysAreExactlyTheLayeredKeysNoProjectMaySet()},
     * so this sentence going stale reds a test rather than misleading a reader:
     *
     * `provider` is not "which of my accounts". The value is a NAME, and
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Providers\ProviderFactory::defaultConfig()}
     * resolves a name it does not recognise against the `providers` map of a
     * `config.dev.json` — a map whose entries carry `base_uri`. So the set a
     * project-chosen name resolves against is not one the user enumerated, and
     * the miss path is a file read. Switching provider also switches which API
     * key is spent and which host every prompt in the session is sent to, which
     * is the one decision that should never be made by a file that arrived with
     * a clone.
     *
     * `instructions` is a list of globs whose FILE CONTENTS
     * ({@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\InstructionFileLoader::loadForced()})
     * become part of the system prompt. Containment keeps those globs inside the
     * checkout, so a project value cannot read outside it — the harm is not a
     * file-read primitive, it is that "forced" means the user declared this text
     * authoritative. A project value would let a repository force any file it
     * ships, under any name, which is precisely the review a user performs by
     * looking at the instruction files they know about.
     *
     * NO `src/` CONSUMER, DELIBERATELY, and it is a seam rather than dead code.
     * {@see projectLayer()} filters on {@see PROJECT_TIER_KEYS} — the positive
     * list — because that is the direction a filter has to run in; the

     * doc-block, in `sugar-crush/README.md` and in
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Config\LayeredSettingsTest::testTheUserTierOnlyKeysAreExactlyTheLayeredKeysNoProjectMaySet()}.
