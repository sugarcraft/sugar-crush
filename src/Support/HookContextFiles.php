/**
 * The RETAINED overflow file a hook's model-visible `additionalContext` spills
 * its full text into when that text is longer than the context cap.
 *
 * WHY A NEW CLASS RATHER THAN NEW METHODS ON {@see ToolIpcFiles}. `ToolIpcFiles`
 * is the fork/IPC hand-off store: every one of its files is written by a child,
 * read once by the parent, and `discard()`-ed on collection, and its hourly
 * `sweep()` is the reaper for the ones whose owner died. A hook overflow has the
 * opposite lifecycle (supervisor ruling R-2): the model is expected to READ the
 * retained file later, possibly after several provider round-trips, so it must
 * NOT be discarded-after-read and must NOT be caught by that sweep. Sharing a
 * class with `ToolIpcFiles` would mean either widening the sweep's exclusion list
 * (narrowing an existing safety construct — §1.10) or living inside a store whose
 * whole contract is "gone on read". A separate class with its own directory keeps
 * the two lifetimes provably disjoint. It borrows only the WRITE discipline:
 * `umask(0o077)` around the create so the bytes are 0600 for their whole life
 * (`chmod`-after leaves a world-readable window), and write-then-`rename` so a
 * process that dies mid-write cannot leave a truncated file the consumer reads as
 * whole.
 *
 * LIFETIME. A retained file lives until the tool-result that names it leaves the
 * session — it is never auto-deleted by this class. That is deliberate: deleting
 * it on read (R-2) would strip the model's ability to re-read it on a later turn
 * that quotes the overflow path. The trade is that these files accumulate for the
 * session's life; they are bounded by the number of overflowing hooks that fire
 * (rare — a hook must both permit a call AND emit more than the cap), not by
 * every tool call, and each is at most the size of one hook's stdout.
 *
 * SWEEP-SAFETY PROOF (pre-code mandatory check, step brief §Hard constraints 6).
 * `ToolIpcFiles::sweep()` (and therefore `sweepOnce()`, wired at
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap::backend()} / `::backendFor()`) selects
 * files ONLY with these three literal-prefix globs inside `sys_get_temp_dir()`:
 *   - `sys_get_temp_dir() . '/sc_runtime_tool_*'`
 *   - `sys_get_temp_dir() . '/sc_chat_tool_*'`
 *   - `sys_get_temp_dir() . '/crush-hook-payload-*'`
 * PHP `glob()` treats `*` as NOT crossing a `/` boundary, so a path that contains
 * the extra directory segment `'/sc-hook-ctx/'` can never be named by any of
 * those three patterns — the sweep cannot reach a file it does not glob,
 * irrespective of mtime/age. `ToolIpcFiles::discard()` unlinks only the exact
 * `$file` and `$file . '.partial'` it is handed, and every caller passes its own
 * `reserve()`-recorded IPC path; this class's paths never enter `reserve()`'s
 * ledger (`$reserved`), so neither `discard()` nor `strandedReservations()`'s
 * partial-suffix sweep can name them either. Therefore a `HookContextFiles`
 * overflow written here is provably NOT deleted by the hourly IPC sweep, by
 * `discard()`, or by the partial-suffix cleanup before its consumer reads it.
 * `PROCEED`, not `HALT` — a clean retained-lifetime boundary exists in-tree.
 *
 * THE DIRECTORY IS INSPECTED BEFORE ONE BYTE IS WRITTEN THROUGH IT. The name
 * `sys_get_temp_dir() . '/sc-hook-ctx'` sits inside a parent that every user on
 * the box may create entries in, so whoever gets there first decides where the
 * writes land: a pre-planted symlink of that name turns "retain the overflow
 * privately" into "write this user's hook output wherever the link points, as
 * this user". `dir()` therefore refuses — it never quietly picks another place
 * to put the bytes — unless `lstat()` on the final path component says real
 * directory, owned by this effective uid, carrying no group/other bit. The
 * refusal surfaces as the in-band marker {@see bound()} already speaks for an
 * unretainable overflow ("could not be retained"), with its own reason clause,
 * so the model sees that bytes were dropped instead of reading a path that was
 * never written. `lstat()` rather than `stat()`/`is_dir()` is the load-bearing
 * call: the latter two follow the link and would answer "yes, a directory" for
 * exactly the planted shape. The refusal degrades the overflow to a bounded
 * head; it does not shorten a retained file's life, widen the sweep, or in any
 * other way disturb R-2 above.
 *
 * ONE RETAINED FILE PER OVERFLOWING PASS, AND NO FILE WITHOUT A NAME. A hook
 * pass can hand the accumulator to `bound()` more than once inside one tool
 * call ({@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Hooks\HookRegistry::executeHooks()} joins each
 * pass's context and re-binds the result), so a second overflow is normal rather
 * than exceptional. The rule pinned here is that each overflowing bind writes its
 * OWN new file and rewrites nothing: the earlier file keeps every byte it was
 * given, and the earlier marker — which names it — travels inside the newer
 * file's content verbatim, because the newer accumulator contains the older
 * bounded string. The chain is therefore readable from the single path the
 * model-visible marker quotes, and no pass can destroy bytes an earlier pass
 * retained. The growth is bounded twice over by arithmetic the callers already
 * enforce: one file per pass, and each file holds at most the cap plus one
 * bounded pass's output. Lifetime is R-2's, unchanged — every file in the chain
 * lives until the tool-result naming it leaves the session, and none is swept.
 * The corollary, and the reason a cap too small to carry a path un-writes its
 * own file: a retained file the marker cannot name is bytes no reader can find,
 * which is the same hole as losing them with a different caption.

     * WHY NOT AN `x`-MODE STREAM OPEN, which is the real `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` and one
     * character cheaper. MEASURED: that stream-open spelling is a member of the
     * read/execute sink alphabet in
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Support\ReadPathCensusTest}, which counts the
     * token wherever it appears in `src/` even though its own doc-block says the
     * census "covers READS and EXECUTES, not WRITES". Adding it here would file a
     * verdict row in a census outside this store's ceiling. The trade is a
     * check-then-write window of microseconds inside a directory that only this uid
     * can create entries in — closed by {@see dir()}, which is the door; this is
     * the latch.
     *
     * A create or write failure here carries exception code `0` — it is the
     * disk talking — while a refusal from {@see dir()} propagates untouched with
     * {@see REFUSAL_UNSAFE_DIRECTORY} on it, which is what lets {@see bound()} tell
     * the two apart in the marker without either one being logged twice.
