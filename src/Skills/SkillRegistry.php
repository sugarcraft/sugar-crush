     * The most compiled patterns {@see $compiledPathPatterns} will hold before
     * it is emptied and refilled.
     *
     * WHY THERE IS A CAP AT ALL. The cache is keyed by the raw pattern and
     * lives for the process, and the bound everyone reasoned from — "the
     * pattern set is the skills installed on the box" — is a property of
     * today's CALLERS, not of this class. {@see pathMatches()} is `public
     * static`; a future `/skill` verb taking a glob, or a user-supplied
     * `paths:` filter, would feed it distinct patterns per request and nothing
     * here would object. E99.
     *
     * WHY 1,024, AND NOT A NUMBER A REAL ROSTER COULD REACH. MEASURED on this
     * tree by {@see Skill::fromFile()} over `src/Skills/BuiltIn/*\/SKILL.md`:
     * the twelve shipped built-ins declare FOUR distinct `paths:` globs between
     * them (`composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `**\/*.php`, `**\/*Test.php`),
     * across five `paths:` entries, and no skill declares more than two. 1,024
     * is 256x that, so a roster would need ~200 skills each declaring five
     * DISTINCT globs before it noticed the cap exists. Every one of those
     * numbers is re-derived from the shipped frontmatter and from this constant
     * by {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Skills\CompiledPatternCacheBoundTest},
     * and this paragraph reds if any of them stops being true — a figure in a
     * comment is not a measurement. What the cap costs when it is never reached
     * is one integer comparison on a cache MISS — a hit does not reach the
     * branch at all.
     *
     * WHAT IT BOUNDS. Feeding 20,000 fabricated distinct patterns
     * (`src/gen<i>/**\/*.php`, i = 0..19,999) through {@see pathMatches()} and
     * sampling `count()` on every insertion: uncapped the map reaches all
     * 20,000 entries, capped it peaks at exactly 1,024 and settles at 544
     * (20,000 mod 1,024). The ENTRY figures are exact, version-independent and
     * pinned by the test above.
     *
     * THE BYTE FIGURES ARE A GENERATOR'S, NOT THE CACHE'S, and the earlier
     * version of this paragraph presented them as the cache's.
     *
     *   WHAT IT SAID. "Uncapped … 3,661,552 bytes of PHP heap (183 B/entry);
     *   capped … 213,648 bytes (209 B/entry — the per-entry figure is larger at
     *   the smaller size because a PHP hashtable's fixed overhead is amortised
     *   over fewer slots)."
     *
     *   WHAT IS TRUE NOW. Neither byte figure reproduces, and the explanation
     *   attached to them is inverted. MEASURED on PHP 8.3.6 with the instrument
     *   named — a `memory_get_usage(false)` delta around building the array and
     *   nothing else, identical to the byte across three runs — 20,000 entries
     *   cost 3,549,976 B (177.5 B/entry) and 1,024 cost 154,904 B (151.3
     *   B/entry). So per-entry goes UP with n here, not down, and the reason is
     *   the generator rather than the hashtable: `src/gen19999/**\/*.php` is
     *   four bytes longer than `src/gen0/**\/*.php`, and the key and the
     *   compiled value both carry that. The hashtable alone (same keys and
     *   values, pre-built outside the measured window) is 40.1 B/entry at 1,024
     *   and 65.5 B/entry at 20,000.
     *
     *   WHY THE BOUND STILL EARNS ITS PLACE. The decision never rested on the
     *   byte totals — it rests on "20,000 entries or 1,024", which is exact and
     *   reproduces. What the byte figures were for is the reader asking whether
     *   1,024 is a sane ceiling in memory terms, and at ~150 KB it plainly is.
     *   They are not pinned by a test, deliberately: a byte count is an
     *   allocator's answer and would red on PHP 8.4 or another build for no
     *   defect. They carry their generator and their instrument instead, which
     *   is what makes them re-takeable — and is the whole of what was missing.
     *
     * WHAT THE CAP COSTS WHEN IT IS NEVER REACHED, and it is not zero. The
     * lookup went from `??=` to `?? null` plus an explicit null test, because
     * the count check has to sit on the miss branch only. MEASURED as an
     * interleaved A/B in one process — same generator as below, both arms
     * sharing one compile closure, arm order alternated per run, two takes of
     * three runs — the capped lookup is +1.0% to +4.9% (five of six takes
     * 4.2-4.9%), i.e. about +8 ns on a call that costs ~290 ns. Paid
     * deliberately: it buys a bound on a `public static` entry point whose
     * previous bound was a property of its callers.
     *
     * AND WHAT IT COSTS WHEN IT IS REACHED. Cycling 1,025 distinct patterns
     * five times over — every call a miss, every 1,024th a wipe — ran at
     * 3.67/2.73/2.73 us per call across three runs, against 2.48 us for
     * translating on every call with no cache at all. So the degenerate case
     * is "no cache", not "worse than no cache": correct, merely unaccelerated.

     * Compiled `paths:` globs, keyed by the raw pattern.

     * {@see pathMatches()} per pattern per path on tool calls, and a fresh
     * registry per session would otherwise recompile the same handful of
     * frontmatter globs from scratch.
     *
     * WHAT THIS USED TO SAY, AND ONLY THAT: the sentence above, ending at
     * "from scratch". WHAT IS TRUE NOW: the sentence is still right about the
     * shipped callers and was never a bound on the CLASS — see
     * {@see MAX_COMPILED_PATTERNS}, which makes it one. WHY IT STILL EARNS ITS
     * PLACE: it is the reason the cache exists, and the reason the cap can be
     * set high enough to be unreachable in practice rather than tuned.
     *
     * THE MEMOISATION IS NOT DECORATION — this was measured before the cap was
     * chosen, because "just drop the cache" is the other way to bound it.
     *
     * GENERATOR, stated completely because two of its parameters move the
     * answer by more than the run-to-run noise and the first version of this
     * paragraph named neither. 8 patterns x 40 paths x 200 trials = 64,000
     * pairs per arm, no randomness, three runs per configuration, PHP 8.3.6
     * (the only interpreter on the box these were taken on; no 8.4 claim is
     * made). The patterns are the five in {@see pathMatches()}'s perf note plus
     * the three shipped leading-`**` globs, which is `**\/*.php` twice and
     * `**\/*Test.php` — SIX distinct patterns in an eight-slot list, and the
     * duplicates matter because the memoised arm caches by pattern. The paths
     * are `src/` + 8 segments + a filename, and THE SEGMENT LENGTH IS THE FREE
     * PARAMETER: it sets the per-match cost, which is the ratio's denominator.
     *
     * MEASURED, three runs each, ratio = translate-every-call / memoised:
     *
     *   1-char segments  (53-byte paths) -> 8.64x / 8.65x / 8.65x
     *   12-char segments (117-byte paths) -> 7.54x / 7.54x / 7.58x
     *
     * Swap the two duplicate patterns for `composer.json` and `composer.lock`
     * — eight DISTINCT patterns, a more expensive translate arm — and the same
     * two configurations give 9.50x-9.56x and 8.29x-8.36x. So the honest figure
     * is "between roughly 7x and 10x on this box, depending on how long the
     * paths are and how many patterns are distinct", not a two-decimal band.
     *
     *   WHAT THIS USED TO SAY. "8.53x-8.68x, stable well inside the spread …
     *   1.46 us per translation against 0.17 us per match." WHAT IS TRUE NOW.
     *   The 8.53x-8.68x reproduces exactly — but only for the 1-char
     *   configuration, and "the spread" it was called stable inside was one
     *   unstated generator's. The two microsecond figures cannot both belong to
     *   that run: 0.1591s minus 0.0108s over 64,000 pairs is 2.32 us per
     *   translation, not 1.46, and 1.46-1.60 us is what `compilePathPattern()`
     *   costs for the CHEAPEST pattern in the set (`**\/*.php`) measured on its
     *   own. Re-taken here with one generator throughout: 2.16-2.19 us per
     *   translation, 0.13 us per match at 1-char segments and 0.17 us at
     *   12-char. WHY THE PARAGRAPH STILL EARNS ITS PLACE. Every configuration
     *   says the same thing by an order of magnitude, so the DECISION the
     *   figures were taken to support — keep the memo, bound it, do not delete
     *   it — was never in doubt. What was wrong was the precision, and a
     *   two-decimal ratio invites the next reader to treat a re-take that lands
     *   at 7.5x as a regression.
     *
     * Dropping the cache would make this matcher SLOWER than the
     * `str_replace` predicate it replaced, which is the whole reason the cap is
     * a cap and not a deletion.

     * Does one `paths:` frontmatter glob claim one file path?
     *
     * WHAT THE CODE HERE USED TO SAY: `fnmatch($pattern, $path)` first, and
     * then — only when the pattern contained `**` — three textual rewrites
     * whose comments read "Convert /**\/ to /*\/ (matches one directory
     * level)", "Convert /** at end to /* (matches one directory or zero)" and
     * "Also try without the ** entirely (matches zero directories)", ORed
     * together.
     *
     * WHAT IS TRUE NOW: all three rewrites were keyed on a SLASH BEFORE the
     * `**`, so a pattern that STARTS with one — `**\/*.php`, the first form
     * most people write — matched none of them and fell through to the bare
     * `fnmatch()`, which on PHP 8.3.6 with no flags reads `**\/` as "some
     * characters, then a literal slash". MEASURED on this box, PHP 8.3.6:
     * `fnmatch('**\/*.php', 'a.php')` is `false`, so a skill scoped to every
     * PHP file in the tree did not claim the PHP files at the tree's root, and
     * the same hole silenced `**\/node_modules/**` for `node_modules/x/y.js`.
     * That is E85.
     *
     * AND A SECOND HOLE THE BRIEF DID NOT NAME, found by the characterisation
     * table rather than by reading the rewrites: `str_replace()` replaces
     * NON-OVERLAPPING occurrences, and the `/**\/` needle ends in the slash
     * the next one would have started with. So on `a/**\/**\/b` only the
     * first is rewritten — the scan resumes past the shared slash — and the
     * result `a/*\/**\/b` demands three separators where the pattern's author
     * asked for one or more. VERIFIED on PHP 8.3.6: none of the four old
     * branches claimed `a/x/b`. A regex translation replaces the rewrites and
     * closes both.
     *
     * WHY THE OLD REASONING STILL EARNS ITS PLACE: the three rewrites were
     * describing real semantics that `fnmatch` has no way to express — `**`
     * spanning zero directories is exactly what a bare `fnmatch` cannot do,
     * because its wildcards cannot match "nothing, INCLUDING the separator
     * beside it". Every case the rewrites bought is bought again below, on
     * purpose: `/**` compiles to `(?:/.*)?`, which is the union of "one or
     * more directories" (their rewrite 2) and "zero directories" (their
     * rewrite 3), and a `/**\/` in the middle is the same union followed by
     * the next literal segment (their rewrite 1).
     *
     * SEMANTICS DELIBERATELY PRESERVED, not tidied: a single `*` here matches
     * ACROSS `/`, and `?` matches `/` too. That is not the POSIX-shell reading
     * — it is what `fnmatch()` does when the caller passes no `FNM_PATHNAME`,
     * which this call site never did. VERIFIED on PHP 8.3.6:
     * `fnmatch('*.php', 'src/a.php')` is `true` without flags and `false` with
     * `FNM_PATHNAME`. Narrowing `*` to a single segment would be the more
     * conventional glob, and it would silently stop matching paths that match
     * today — every `src/*` skill would quietly lose its subdirectories. So
     * the translation is meant to widen and never narrow.
     *
     * "NEVER NARROWS" IS A MEASUREMENT AND NOT A THEOREM, and getting that
     * backwards cost a round. WHAT THIS DOC-BLOCK SAID BEFORE: that never-
     * narrows was a THEOREM, on the grounds that {@see legacyPathMatch()}
     * still holds the three rewrites. WHAT IS TRUE NOW: that inference is
     * inverted. `legacyPathMatch()` is consulted ONLY when the translation
     * emits a regex PCRE will not compile. For every pattern that DOES
     * compile — which is very nearly all of them — the translation is the
     * whole answer and the old predicate is never asked, so keeping the
     * rewrites in the fallback buys correctness for uncompilable patterns and
     * buys exactly nothing for narrowing. WHY THE CLAIM STILL EARNS ITS PLACE:
     * because it is now measured on two independent samples rather than
     * deduced from one. (1) The 46 x 54 = 2,484-pair grid captured against the
     * old predicate at 8416d98e: 0 of its 329 matches lost, 49 gained — and
     * its alphabet was WIDENED this round by exactly the four paths and four
     * patterns the four families below need, so the grid can now see what it
     * was previously green over. (2) A
     * seeded differential fuzz — 200,000 trials per seed at each of
     * `mt_srand(1)`, `(20260822)`, `(987654321)` and `(42)`; pattern alphabet
     * `[a b / * ** *** ? . [ab] [!a] [a-c] [\d] []] [[:alpha:]] \* \] x - _ p
     * h]`, path alphabet `[a b / x . p h \n - _ * [ ] c 5 \]`, both 1-8
     * tokens, PHP 8.3.6 — which reports 0 narrowings on every seed and 14-17
     * widenings, every widening a leading globstar BY CAUSE and not merely by
     * prefix: strip the leading star run and the old predicate claims the
     * path. Each run is deterministic; the four seeds are there because ONE
     * seed is a sample too, and widening the alphabet to include
     * `[[:alpha:]]` is what exposed the fourth family below. The grid is
     * pinned in
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Skills\SkillPathPatternTest}; the fuzz is
     * a generator, restated here so the figure can be re-taken.
     *
     * THE FUZZ IS NOT DECORATION: it found FOUR narrowing families the grid
     * was green over, all four of them after the grid was written, which is
     * the whole argument for not trusting a grid alone, and the fourth arrived
     * only after the fuzz's own alphabet was widened — a generator has a
     * window too. Each is closed below and each is pinned by its own case in
     * that test:
     *
     *  - NEWLINE IN THE PATH. PCRE's `.` does not cross `\n` without /s;
     *    `fnmatch()`'s `*` and `?` do. MEASURED, PHP 8.3.6:
     *    `fnmatch('*.php', "a\nb.php")` is true. Closed by the /s on the
     *    compiled delimiter. NO path in the grid as it then stood contained a
     *    newline, so it was blind to this BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by
     *    omission; one has since been added.
     *  - `X/***`, three or more stars after a slash. Closed in the `/**`
     *    branch of {@see compilePathPattern()}. Note that `src/***` was
     *    ALREADY one of the grid's pattern rows: the pattern was characterised
     *    and its 50 paths simply held nothing that could expose the
     *    difference. A window defect, not a coverage gap — the distinction
     *    matters, because adding more patterns would never have found it and
     *    adding one path did.
     *  - PCRE ESCAPES INSIDE A CLASS BODY. `[\d]` means the literal `d` to
     *    `fnmatch()` and the digit class to PCRE. Closed by the class-body
     *    step of {@see PathGlob::compile()}.
     *  - A POSIX CLASS FOLLOWED BY A SECOND BRACKET GROUP. The scan that finds
     *    a class's closing `]` did not know that `[:alpha:]` carries a `]` of
     *    its own, so it stopped early and the emitted class ran past its own
     *    terminator. Harmless while the result failed to compile; NOT harmless
     *    when a later `[` supplies the missing `]`. MEASURED on PHP 8.3.6:
     *    `[[:alpha:]][!a]` emitted `#^[[:alpha:]\][^a]$#Ds`, which compiles,
     *    folds the second group into the first class, and answers false for
     *    `ab` where `fnmatch()` answers true — a wrong answer with no fallback
     *    under it. Closed in the bracket scan of {@see compilePathPattern()}
     *    and in its class-body step, which now pass POSIX classes
     *    through verbatim rather than routing them anywhere.
     *
     * FASTER, INCIDENTALLY, WHICH MATTERS BECAUSE THIS IS ON A TOOL-CALL PATH:
     * {@see SkillPathNudge} runs this per pattern per path, and a
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tools\BuiltIn\Glob} hands over a whole match
     * list. GENERATOR, so the figure can be re-taken: 5 patterns
     * (`**\/*.php`, `src/**\/*.php`, `a/**\/b/**\/c/**\/d`, `docs/**\/*.md`,
     * `**\/node_modules/**`) x 40 paths of the form `src/` + 8 path segments
     * + a filename, 200 trials = 40,000 pairs, no randomness, PHP 8.3.6.
     * RE-TAKEN at the commit that closed the three narrowing families, three
     * runs: old 0.0269s / 0.0277s / 0.0274s, new 0.0087s / 0.0087s / 0.0087s —
     * 0.31x-0.33x, one cached `preg_match` where the old path ran up to four
     * `fnmatch()` calls plus three `str_replace()` rewrites. An earlier take on
     * this same box read 0.033s / 0.0095s = 0.29x; the RATIO is stable to
     * within the box's own drift and the absolute times are not, so quote the
     * ratio and re-take the rest. /s and the class-body walk cost nothing here
     * — the walk happens once per pattern, at compile.
     *
     * A deliberately pathological case (three globstars against a
     * 60-segment non-matching path) ran 2,000 times in 0.0004s: the leading
     * literal anchors it, so PCRE fails before it can backtrack. The
     * `preg_match() === false` branch catches a backtrack limit anyway.
     *
     * AND THE THREE REWRITES ARE STILL HERE, in {@see legacyPathMatch()} —
     * for the reason above this one and NOT for never-narrows: a pattern this
     * translation cannot compile is a SUPPORTED shape, not malformed input.
     *
     * WHAT THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO SAY: that the shape in question was the
     * POSIX character class `fnmatch()` inherits from libc, which the
     * translation could not express.
     * WHAT IS TRUE NOW: POSIX classes are translated, and correctly — PCRE
     * spells them the same way, so `[[:alpha:]]` is a passthrough. The old
     * claim was also broader than the fact even when it was written: a POSIX
     * class only reached the fallback when the malformed class it produced
     * happened NOT to compile, and when a later `[` completed it the pattern
     * got a wrong answer with no fallback at all. That is fixed above.
     * WHY THE FALLBACK STILL EARNS ITS PLACE: because a different supported
     * shape still cannot be compiled — a backslash-escaped `]` inside a class.
     * MEASURED on PHP 8.3.6: `fnmatch('a[\]]b', 'a]b')` is `true`, while the
     * bracket scan here is not escape-aware, stops on the escaped `]`, and
     * emits `#^a[\]\]b$#Ds`, whose class never terminates. Answering `false`
     * there would narrow the matcher, and answering with a bare `fnmatch()`
     * would throw away the zero-directory `**` case the rewrites bought — see
     * the discriminating pair in
     * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Skills\SkillPathPatternTest::testAnEscapedClassTerminatorIsLeftToTheFullOldPredicate()}.
     * Keeping the rewrites as that pattern's answer also means the one thing a
     * compile failure can never do is make the tool call throw.
