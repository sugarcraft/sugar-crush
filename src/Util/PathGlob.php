/**
 * THE ONE path-glob dialect: a glob string and a path string go in, a verdict
 * comes out. No filesystem, no repository root, no state — pure string in,
 * string/bool out, so it stays invisible to the read-sink census over `src/`
 * exactly as {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\Triggers\PathTrigger} documents
 * for its own answer.
 *
 * This is the single compiler P6.S5a asked for. Before it, three places in
 * `sugar-crush` answered "does this path match this pattern" in three
 * mutually incompatible ways — `PathTrigger::pattern()` (segment-scoped `*`),
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Skills\SkillRegistry::compilePathPattern()} (the
 * dialect below), and {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Skills\SkillRegistry::legacyPathMatch()}
 * (`fnmatch()` plus three string rewrites). Both PRODUCTION matchers now route
 * through this file; the third is left where it is and its divergence is
 * recorded rather than absorbed — see THE FALLBACKS ARE NOT PART OF THE
 * DIALECT below.
 *
 * WHY THE NAME `PathGlob`. The class is the dialect, not a matcher object: it
 * holds no pattern and answers no per-instance question, so `GlobMatcher` would
 * promise an instance that does not exist and a `Matcher` suffix would collide
 * with the `Match`/`Matcher` vocabulary of `candy-fuzzy`. `PathGlob::compile()`
 * and `PathGlob::matchCompiled()` read as what they do, and the neutral
 * `SugarCraft\Crush\Util\` home follows {@see TokenTracker} — the one existing
 * utility both `Context\` and `Skills\` consumers could reach without either
 * subnamespace depending on the other.
 *
 * WHY THIS DIALECT AND NOT THE STRICTER SHELL ONE — RULED, DO NOT "FIX" THE
 * LOOSENESS BACK. The stricter reading (`*` stops at `/`, as bash without
 * `extglob` and minimatch's default) is defensible in isolation and was the
 * `PathTrigger` answer until this step. It is the wrong answer HERE, for four
 * reasons, each measured over the 33-row differential in
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Context\GlobDialectDifferentialTest}:
 *
 *  1. IT IS THE PLAN'S OWN INTENT. The motivating example is a glob of
 *     "`*\/tests/**\/*.php` wherever they live", and row #26 (of the #25-#27
 *     family) measures that `a/b/tests/FooTest.php` — two leading segments —
 *     answers NO under the strict compiler and YES under this one. "Wherever
 *     they live" is this answer; the plan's own example does not work under
 *     the other.
 *  2. NON-NARROWING IS REPO LAW, AND IT BINDS THE LIVE MATCHER. Unifying the
 *     other way turns off capability that exists today: row #6, a skill
 *     declaring `src/*.php` that announces for `src/deep/x.php`, and row #32,
 *     bare `*` against `a/b.php`. Making `*` segment-scoped would silently stop
 *     those announcements. This direction moves nothing that ships: the skill
 *     channel's answer is proven identical over 130,317 pattern-path pairs
 *     (363 patterns x 359 paths), and the thirteen rows the rule trigger
 *     moves on - ten wider, three narrower —
 *     are moves in a matcher that had no production reader when this step ran
 *     (reason 3). The three narrowings are rows #11, #22 and #23, every one of
 *     them a `[` or a `\` the strict dialect matched as a literal and this one
 *     reads as syntax; they are recorded here rather than glossed.
 *  3. THE COST IS ASYMMETRIC. `PathTrigger` had no production reader at all
 *     when this step ran — nothing consumes `Rule->triggers()`; the only
 *     references were `Rule.php`'s own `mutate()` carry and a comment in
 *     `Runtime.php`. So changing it affects no shipped behaviour. This
 *     dialect's matcher is live, on a tool-call path.
 *  4. PRODUCT CONSISTENCY. Every other user-facing `paths:` in this product is
 *     a `SKILL.md` frontmatter field read here. A rule author copying a working
 *     `paths:` value out of a `SKILL.md` into a rule must not get a different
 *     language for it.
 *
 * THE DIALECT, stated to the character:
 * - `**` spans anything, including `/`. Preceded by a separator it makes that
 *   separator optional, so `a/**\/b` claims `a/b` as well as `a/x/y/b`, and
 *   `a/**` claims `a` itself (row #5 — the strict compiler required the
 *   separator). Three or more stars keep the older predicate's wider answer on
 *   purpose; see the comment at that branch.
 * - A leading `**\/` is zero or more leading directories, so `**\/*.php` claims
 *   `a.php` at the root of the tree (row #31).
 * - `*` matches ANY run of characters including `/` (rows #6, #32). `?`
 *   matches any single character including `/` (rows #8, #9).
 * - `[…]` is a character class, `fnmatch()`'s reading of it: `!` negates, a
 *   POSIX class such as `[[:alpha:]]` passes through, and an unterminated `[`
 *   is a literal (rows #10-#13). `{a,b}` braces are NOT alternation — they
 *   match themselves (rows #14, #15).
 * - A backslash escapes the next character, because that is what `fnmatch()`
 *   does when `FNM_NOESCAPE` is not passed (rows #21-#23). Windows separators
 *   therefore do not survive as literals; that is `fnmatch()`'s answer, not a
 *   choice made here.
 * - Matching is case-SENSITIVE (row #16), anchored at both ends, and BYTE-wise:
 *   the compiled pattern carries `#Ds` and deliberately NO `u`, so a path
 *   holding bytes that are not valid UTF-8 matches literally instead of failing
 *   the subject wholesale (row #24). `/D` stops a trailing newline in a path
 *   from satisfying `$`; `/s` stops an embedded one from defeating a wildcard
 *   (rows #28, #29).
 *
 * THE FALLBACKS ARE NOT PART OF THE DIALECT, and a reader who "simplifies" this
 * file must keep both facts true:
 * - {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Skills\SkillRegistry::legacyPathMatch()} answers
 *   the patterns this compiler cannot compile (a backslash-escaped `]` inside a
 *   class, a reversed range). It is a THIRD dialect: row #31 measures
 *   `**\/*.php` against `a.php` as YES here and NO there. It stays reachable
 *   exactly as it was — not deleted, not stubbed, not narrowed.
 * - {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Context\Triggers\PathTrigger} answers a glob this
 *   compiler cannot compile as NO match, where the skill channel answers it
 *   from that fallback. Both callers get `matchCompiled()`'s `null` and decide
 *   their own policy; the policy difference is pinned in
 *   {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Context\GlobDialectDifferentialTest}.
 *
 * THIS FILE MUST NEVER TOUCH THE FILESYSTEM or read a repository root.
 * Matching is not authorisation: `/etc/passwd` matches `**` like any other
 * string (row #17), and the containment gate belongs to whoever calls this.
