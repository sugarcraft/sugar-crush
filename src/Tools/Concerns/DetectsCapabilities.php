/**
 * Which optional host search binaries are genuinely installed, so a tool
 * description can offer one without lying about it.
 *
 * THE CARRIER IS THE BOOT FACTORY, NOT THE TOOL. {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Cli\Bootstrap}
 * asks once per launch and passes the answer down as a constructor boolean to
 * the tool whose prose consumes it ({@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tools\BuiltIn\Grep}
 * for `rg`, {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tools\BuiltIn\Glob} for `fd`). That split is
 * forced before it is chosen: both tools are `final readonly class`es, and PHP
 * refuses a readonly class that uses a trait declaring a property — a static one
 * included, since `readonly` cannot modify a static — so a memoizing trait
 * cannot live on either tool. Measured on this tree, not recalled from a manual.
 *
 * What the split buys is the rule the whole step turns on: `description()` stays
 * a pure function of the instance, so a golden prompt renders the same bytes on
 * a machine with `rg` installed and one without. A probe reached lazily from
 * inside `description()` would make rendered text a function of whichever shell
 * built it.
 *
 * THE ANSWER COMES FROM A STAT WALK AND NEVER FROM A SUBPROCESS, which is the
 * load-bearing half of this file. `proc_open(['rg', '--version'])` on a host
 * without `rg` emits a PHP warning, and `phpunit.xml` sets `failOnWarning` — so
 * the idiomatic capability probe turns every suite run on a plain container into
 * a red one. That exact hazard is why
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\ClaudeCodeMcpClient::resolveExecutable()} pre-validates
 * a command before spawning it, and this walk is that primitive duplicated on
 * purpose: reaching into an unrelated backend's private method would be a
 * dependency pointing the wrong way, and ~20 lines of stat calls are cheaper
 * than either that or an edit outside this step's file ceiling.
 *
 * Memoized in a static keyed by binary — the house idiom is
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tools\BuiltIn\Doctor::execute()}'s `self::$mosaic ??=`
 * — so a launch that walks `app()`, `backend()` and `backendFor()` in sequence
 * still pays for one scan per name, and the second ask is a hash lookup.
