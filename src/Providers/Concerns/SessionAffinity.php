/**
 * The hashed session-affinity header every declared provider transport puts
 * on the wire, so a caching gateway can route one session's calls to the
 * same warm backend (prompt_plan.md P10.S4; Mirrors charmbracelet/crush
 * sessionHeaders(call.SessionID)).
 *
 * WHY HASHED AND NOT RAW — the plan's hard constraint. A raw session id in a
 * header is a per-user prefix: a gateway keying affinity on it would pin
 * every cache entry to one user, defeating the cross-user prompt-cache sharing
 * the same gateway exists to provide, and it leaks a persistent user-linked
 * identifier to every proxy hop between here and the model. `hash('sha256', …)`
 * keeps the routing property — same session, same value, so same warm backend —
 * while the value identifies nothing outside this session's own traffic, and
 * two sessions never collide.
 *
 * WHY THE FULL 64 HEX, NO TRUNCATION. In-tree precedent is unanimous:
 * `ContextCompactor::exchangeKey()` and every other `hash('sha256', …)` user
 * in `src/` ship the full digest. Cutting it shorter would need a collision
 * analysis the full hex simply does not ask for, and a header value has no
 * size budget worth that analysis.
 *
 * WHY AN ABSENT HEADER RATHER THAN AN EMPTY ONE. Hashing the empty string
 * gives a fine-looking 64-hex constant, and every session-less caller would
 * carry that identical value — pinning all unaffinity'd traffic to one backend
 * and silently concentrating exactly what this header exists to spread. A
 * null or blank id therefore emits no header at all, the same conditional
 * shape `Authorization` takes when there is no api key.
 *
 * CONSUMER CONTRACT — the wiring step has not landed yet. The id must be the
 * CURRENT session's: `Chat::$currentSessionId` changes under `/resume`,
 * `/branch` and Ctrl+Tab, so a provider built with a stale id keeps hashing
 * the previous session; when the live wiring ships it must pass the id at
 * construction and re-construct (or the factory re-take) on every switch.
 * Until then both providers stay at the default `null` and the wire carries no
 * affinity header — byte-identical to before this trait existed.
 *
 * NOT ROUTED THROUGH THIS TRAIT (enumerated follow-ups, not oversights): the
 * OpenAI-SDK transports, Vertex, Bedrock and the ClaudeCode CLI all carry the
 * session in their own shapes — the CLI passes the raw id to a local
 * `--resume` argument, which is a filesystem handoff, not a proxy header, so
 * the leak analysis above does not apply to it. Only the two OpenAI-compatible
 * HTTP transports declare the header today.
 *
 * THE ID LIVES ON THE HOST CLASS, NOT HERE: both consumers are `final readonly
 * class`es and PHP refuses a readonly class that uses a trait declaring a
 * property, so `sessionAffinityHeaders()` reads the `$sessionAffinityId`
 * promoted constructor property each provider declares itself — the same
 * forced split {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tools\Concerns\DetectsCapabilities}
 * records for its carrier.
