/**
 * Anthropic prompt-cache breakpoints, applied wipe-then-reapply on every step.
 *
 * DESIGN SOURCE: prompt_plan.md P10.S2, executed from prompt_expand.md §4.15
 * (Anthropic's bundled caching spec), §5.8 (charmbracelet/crush's
 * `getCacheControlOptions` / `PrepareStep` discipline), §6.5 (sst/opencode's
 * `applyCaching` refinements) and §9.5 (the SugarCraft sketch). This is a
 * SugarCraft architecture type, not a port — there is no single upstream PHP
 * symbol to mirror, so the repo's "Mirrors charmbracelet/<repo>.<Method>"
 * convention does not apply; the honest lineage is crush's `PrepareStep`
 * closure in Go (§5.8) restated against the Anthropic block shapes this tree
 * already builds in {@see VertexProvider::anthropicBlocks()} and
 * {@see BedrockProvider::systemBlocks()}.
 *
 * WHY WIPE-THEN-REAPPLY. Anthropic accepts at most self::MAX_BREAKPOINTS
 * `cache_control` breakpoints per request. Upstream measured (crush §5.8: "the
 * wipe is the load-bearing part") that without clearing first, each step of a
 * multi-step agentic turn ADDS its marks on top of the previous step's, the
 * request crosses the cap, and the API 400s. So `apply()` is not "add
 * breakpoints"; it is "re-derive the whole breakpoint set from scratch every
 * step", and it is called on every step.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT MARK PLAN (crush §5.8): last tool + last system + last two
 * messages — exactly four. Render order is `tools` → `system` → `messages`
 * (§4.15), so each mark rides the deepest block of its region:
 *   - the last block of the last `role: system` turn — §4.15: "a breakpoint on
 *     the last system block caches both tools and system together";
 *   - the last blocks of the final two messages, with the lookback repair below
 *     substituting intermediate positions when a message boundary would sit too
 *     far back;
 *   - the last tool definition, kept only while it does not crowd out a
 *     lookback-critical message mark (see REPAIR PRIORITY).
 *
 * 20-BLOCK LOOKBACK REPAIR. Each breakpoint walks backward at most
 * self::LOOKBACK_LIMIT content blocks for a prior cache entry (§4.15
 * "20-block lookback window"). A single turn that adds more than that —
 * routine in agentic loops with many tool_use/tool_result blocks — silently
 * misses. The fix §4.15 prescribes is "place an intermediate breakpoint every
 * ~15 blocks in long turns", so the tail marks are derived as a backward
 * chain: anchor on the final content block, then step to the previous
 * message's last block whenever it lies within self::INTERMEDIATE_SPACING
 * blocks, else drop an intermediate mark exactly that far back (mid-message).
 * The chain's head (the final block) always outranks deeper entries.
 *
 * REPAIR PRIORITY. When the chain needs more slots than the budget leaves
 * after the system mark, the LAST-TOOL mark gives way, not a message mark:
 * §4.15 makes the last-system breakpoint cache tools+system together, so
 * losing the tool mark costs a redundant pin, while losing a tail mark costs a
 * silent miss inside the conversation prefix. A tool keeps its own mark
 * whenever the tail chain fits inside the slots left over.
 *
 * AUTOMATIC CACHING BUDGET. Providers/gateways may inject their own cache
 * breakpoint alongside ours (opencode §6.5 skips marking exactly for this
 * case). Such a mark is any `cache_control` whose `type` is NOT 'ephemeral' —
 * e.g. the Bedrock `{"type": "default"}` cachePoint dialect. Those marks are
 * never wiped (they are not this class's to name; silently deleting a
 * mechanism it does not own is §16.4's swallowed-error shape) and never
 * overwritten — a block already carrying one stays unmarked while its region's
 * mark slides to the nearest preceding free block. They DO consume slots from
 * the same per-request cap, so the explicit budget is self::MAX_BREAKPOINTS
 * minus the number observed: self::BUDGET_WITH_AUTOMATIC with exactly one.
 * When the preserved foreign marks ALONE exceed self::MAX_BREAKPOINTS the
 * producer has handed us a request that 400s no matter what we add — a
 * contract violation at the seam, so `apply()` throws naming the count instead
 * of shipping the breach to the wire (§1.10 fail-fast, the same posture as the
 * shape throws). This makes "total breakpoints <= self::MAX_BREAKPOINTS" an
 * invariant of every successful return.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. No clock, no randomness, no filesystem, no environment: same
 * inputs produce byte-identical output, which is what makes the prefix
 * cacheable at all (§4.15's invariant — any change anywhere in the prefix
 * invalidates everything after it). Input arrays are never mutated; fresh
 * copies are returned. apply(apply(x)) === apply(x) holds because the wipe
 * re-derives from scratch — pinned by test, not merely relied on.
 *
 * SHAPES AND THE SKELETON DEVIATION. The plan's skeleton declares
 * `apply(array $messages, array $tools): array` without naming the array
 * shapes or the return shape. This implementation parses Anthropic-wire turns
 * — `['role' => 'system'|'user'|'assistant', 'content' => string|block[]]`,
 * blocks being the `['type' => ..., ...]` arrays {@see VertexProvider} builds
 * and tools the flat `['name' => ..., 'description' => ..., 'input_schema' =>
 * ...]` shape {@see VertexProvider::formatAnthropicTools()} emits. The return
 * is `['tools' => ..., 'messages' => ...]`: both regions receive marks and the
 * signature returns one value, so the two travel keyed together. System rides
 * INSIDE `$messages` as a `role: system` turn (crush's §5.8 model, and §4.15's
 * mid-conversation-system escape hatch) rather than as a third parameter — the
 * skeleton fixed the parameter list, and hoisting to the top-level `system`
 * field stays the provider's own job, exactly as it is today. String content
 * normalises to a single text block (a bare string cannot carry a marker);
 * every other shape fails loudly at the boundary.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TYPE IS FOR TODAY (P10.S2). It ships WITHOUT a production caller
 * by orchestration adjudication — the exact P6.S1 Triggers precedent
 * (prompt_resume.md §3 item 11): per §1.10, shipping the class unwired is the
 * intended state of this step, not a leftover to tidy, and deleting or
 * stubbing it is not an available outcome. The consumer contract: the provider
 * body builder calls `apply()` on every step, immediately before serialising
 * `tools`/`system`/`messages` into an Anthropic-shaped body, once P10.S3's
 * kill switch (`SUGARCRUSH_DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHE`) and the licensing decision
 * on wiring prompt caching land. A successful return guarantees total marks
 * (`tools` + `messages`, ephemeral and preserved-automatic alike) at or below
 * self::MAX_BREAKPOINTS; an input already breaching the cap on foreign marks
 * throws rather than returning a doomed request. Until then nothing in `src/`
 * constructs it; its only callers are its own tests — the record §16.1 asks
 * for.
