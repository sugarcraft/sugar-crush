/**
 * Fires when a file path handed to it matches one of its glob patterns.
 *
 * DESIGN SOURCE: prompt_expand.md §7.5 and §9.7 (a path trigger fires when a
 * matching file enters context). This is a SugarCraft architecture type, not
 * a port — charmbracelet/crush has no PathTrigger symbol, so the repo's
 * "Mirrors charmbracelet/…" convention does not apply.
 *
 * A MATCHER, NOT A GATEKEEPER — the decision this step pins. The trigger
 * answers only "does this string match this pattern"; it knows nothing about
 * any repository root and touches no filesystem (pure string in, bool out —
 * it must stay invisible to the read-sink census over `src/`). An
 * `/etc/passwd`-style absolute path therefore MATCHES `**` like any other
 * string: matching is not authorisation, and the containment gate belongs to
 * the P6.S2 loader that feeds these values, mirroring how the existing
 * matchers in this repo separate matching from gating
 * ({@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Skills\SkillRegistry::pathMatches()}).
 *
 * THE GLOB DIALECT is the one {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Skills\SkillRegistry} has
 * always spoken for `SKILL.md` frontmatter `paths:`, and it is not this class's
 * to define: the compiler lives in {@see PathGlob::compile()}, whose class
 * doc-block states that dialect to the character together with the four
 * measured reasons it was chosen over the stricter shell reading. Reconciling
 * the two is P6.S5a, and it is resolved HERE rather than deferred — see
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Tests\Context\GlobDialectDifferentialTest} for the
 * 33-row differential both sides are pinned against.
 *
 * BEFORE THIS STEP this class compiled its own dialect: a segment-scoped `*`,
 * a `?` that refused `/`, `[…]` that matched only itself, a trailing `/**` that
 * demanded the separator, and no backslash escapes at all. Every one of those
 * five answers differed from the skill channel, and the difference is now gone.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MOVES, stated exactly because "wider" is not the whole truth: over
 * the 33-row differential, 20 rows answer as before, 10 flip from no-match to
 * match, and 3 flip from match to no-match. Every one of the 10 is a wildcard
 * that used to stop at a separator and no longer does - `src/*.php` now fires
 * for `src/deep/x.php`, `src/**` now fires for the bare directory string `src`.
 * All 3 narrowings are a character the strict dialect held as a literal and this
 * one reads as syntax: `[a-z].php` against the same string as itself (row #11),
 * `a\*b` against `a\b` (row #22), and `src\*.php` against `src\a.php` (row #23).
 * Unifying the other way would have narrowed the live skill matcher instead,
 * which repo law forbids; both directions move, and this one moves the half of
 * the tree that answers nothing today.
 *
 * TWO CONSEQUENCES A CALLER MUST KNOW:
 * - The YES-set here is WIDER than it was, deliberately. `src/*.php` now fires
 *   for `src/deep/x.php`, and `src/**` now fires for the bare directory string
 *   `src`. Unifying the other way would have narrowed a live matcher that
 *   announces skills on those very patterns, which repo law forbids.
 * - A glob whose compiled regex PCRE refuses to execute — a backslash-escaped
 *   `]` inside a class, a reversed range — answers NO here, where
 *   {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Skills\SkillRegistry::pathMatches()} answers it from
 *   its `legacyPathMatch()` fallback. That is a POLICY difference and not a
 *   dialect one: this trigger owns no older predicate to fall back to, and a
 *   rule that fired on an answer it never computed is worse than one that stays
 *   silent. Both callers read the same third value out of
 *   {@see PathGlob::matchCompiled()} and decide for themselves.
 *
 * Case-SENSITIVE, BYTE-wise (no `u` modifier, so a path holding bytes that are
 * not valid UTF-8 matches literally instead of failing the subject wholesale),
 * and anchored at both ends — all three inherited from the shared compiler
 * rather than decided here.
