 * "This session has been sitting idle and is bigger than its window" — the

 *
 * Extracted because {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Chat::shouldPromptIdleCompaction()}
 * was a deliberate copy of
 * {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Runtime::shouldPromptIdleCompaction()} (Chat's own
 * docblock said so: the Runtime instance is not reachable from the TUI event
 * loop), and both hardcoded the same threshold independently. The copy stays
 * — Chat still must not reach for a Runtime it does not hold — but both now
 * delegate here, so the two cannot disagree.
 *
 * Both callers keep their own public method: each supplies the token limit
 * from whatever it can see (Chat from its {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Backend},
 * Runtime from its {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Providers\ProviderInterface}).
 *
 * THE FILE NOW CARRIES A SECOND TIER'S NUMBER TOO, and that is said plainly
 * rather than left to be discovered by a reader who assumed otherwise.
 * {@see REFILL_LIMIT} and {@see thrashTripped()} belong to the AUTOMATIC 85%
 * tier, not to the idle one: they are the circuit breaker that stops that tier
 * from compacting a context that refills the moment it is compacted
 * (prompt_expand.md §4.23). They live here because a threshold and the
 * predicate that reads it belong in one place — the same reason this file
 * exists at all, which was two copies of one number disagreeing. Everything
 * above about the idle tier is still exactly true: `IDLE_SECONDS` and
 * {@see shouldPrompt()} are unmoved, and this remains the one place the idle
 * tier's two numbers live.

     * The value is the one the upstream fix names, quoted in that section from

     * immediately after compacting three times in a row and stops with an
     * actionable error instead of burning API calls". Three is therefore not a
     * tuned constant but a reproduced one, and it is generous rather than tight:
     * a compaction is routinely the largest single prompt this app sends, so
     * three of them in a row with nothing gained has already cost the user real
     * money.
     *
     * What counts as "refills to the limit immediately" is measured at compaction
     * COMPLETION, against the same estimate-and-window pair the tier itself used
     * — see {@see \SugarCraft\Crush\Chat}'s `consecutiveRefillCompactions`
     * property, which owns the measurement, and the comment on it for why the
     * rewrite's own post-state is the only honest reading of the phrase.
